HamiltonRestaurant,"I cannot say enough good things about this place. It was really crowded due to the ice fest of all, but we still got waited on really quickly. Our food was out in less than 10 minutes. The hot dogs were literally the best. I have tasted in my life. Everyone was friendly. It was clean. There was such a great atmosphere.  I just loved it definite value for the money",Linda Duncan,Local Guide · 438 reviews · 945 photos,2 months ago,5
HamiltonRestaurant,"We just got take out tonight. Anytime I go to the Hamilton it is Hotchee Dogs with everything for me. The dogs are always great, and the service is great too! The staff at the Hamilton is always super friendly.

The Hamilton has amazing breakfast as well. It’s always nice and warm in there when the weather is cold, and the always comes out hot. It’s my favorite breakfast spot in town.",Greg Musser,9 reviews · 2 photos,2 months ago,5
HamiltonRestaurant,"Missed this restaurant last time we were here on business.   It's cash only!  The waitress was a very wonderful older woman with a bursting personality.   She brought us a chili dog to share, just to try.   Different from Chicago hotdogs,  on an unassuming bun with a slice of white American cheese under the hotdog, with their homemade chile on top with mustard and onions.  I probably have a hotdog once every couple of years.  I have to say I enjoyed it.  We both got the cheeseburger with the chile on it.  I got the onion rings that were highly recommended. They were just ok.  The fries were crispy and crunchy.   She brought a side of gravy to dip in.  I know they roast their turkeys, and everything is homemade, and so was the gravy.   I just wasn't a fan of it for a dipping sauce.  She said we had to come back for the Greek salad with chicken, so that is on our radar if we have time.  Definitely try this place, well established, hometown friendly.",Diane Zuber,Local Guide · 265 reviews · 502 photos,5 months ago,5

HamiltonRestaurant,"I’ve traveled all over the country and have been to many diners, but no where has been as good as The Hamilton. The food is absolutely amazing and they do not cut corners. I ordered the beef club and this is the only diner I’ve been to that makes their own roast beef and uses it in their sandwiches. They also have the BEST coleslaw, I’ve had anywhere. If there is one restaurant to define Carlisle, PA, it would be this one. Give it a try and you won’t regret it! Just remember to bring cash, they do not take credit cards.",Cory Gardner,Local Guide · 52 reviews · 74 photos,2 months ago,5
HamiltonRestaurant,"I have loved the Hamilton since the 80’s. I was a frequent customer until I moved in 2004.  Hands down the best place to eat in Carlisle. Love their Fried Ham Sandwich, fries, chicken dinners & Milkshakes. Staff is so friendly and Tommy has been there a long time.  I don’t blame them for taking cash only.  They have to pay fees for debit/credit card machines. I know I am going I always make sure to carry cash",Cathy Freeman,6 reviews,3 months ago,5

HamiltonRestaurant,"Excellent food and service. Everything is homemade and made to order not reheated in a microwave. The homemade coleslaw is fantastic! The homemade rice pudding is good too. Decent portions. Incredibly reasonable prices - two meals, two desserts for under $40. There are two sections to sit in, with one having a little bit smaller tables, so we were a bit crammed in, and it's a typical loud diner atmosphere, but the food and service is worth it!",Keri Zeigler,Local Guide · 48 reviews · 46 photos,6 months ago,4

HamiltonRestaurant,"Please remember that LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING. While this location is not much to look at, the atmosphere and food make it a great place to go! Home of the infamous ""Hatchii Dog"", this restaurant is owned and operated by a local Greek family; several generations work here daily. There is still an original soda fountain in operation ( vanilla Coke is AWESOME), several booths, and a lunch counter where you can watch the dogs being made. Through an opening in the original restaurant, under the archway, is the side of the Hamilton that serves alcohol. Each day there are daily specials, including homemade soups and sandwiches, along with a breakfast, lunch, and dinner specials. As already started, the decor is outdated, the restaurant is almost bustling, but the Hatchii Dogs with fries and gravy is so worth it!",Lindsey Erhardt,Local Guide · 71 reviews · 367 photos,6 years ago,5

HamiltonRestaurant,"I walked here to get a hatchi dog on the way home as I was out running errands so I pulled out my hatchi dog and started eating, I found a bug mixed into the chili about halfway into the hotdog. It was one of those nat things you see like around water or in the woods/parks. Although that is gross, I have gone to the hamilton many times and have not had a problem. Won't be going back anytime soon tho, Hamilton please check your chili from time to time...If a bug got in then it probably got in through the front doors and landed somewhere in the hotdog area.",Deldius Centurion,Local Guide · 23 reviews,7 months ago,2

The classic, local staple of Carlisle has a diner vibe, attentive service, a family-run atmosphere, and the most famous hotdogs in town.  Chili, cheese, onions, mustard, all on a bun housing a hotdog.  It's classic, it's delicious, and it's messy.  If you want an experience that ""takes you back"" or if you're just craving a quick, cheap bite, you can't go wrong here.  Get gravy fries as a side for a full American meal.",Eduardo Rodriguez,Local Guide · 109 reviews · 32 photos,a year ago,5

Food is  always out within a ten minute time frame, and I’ve gone there for ten years almost now. It’s very well priced also, you can get an entire breakfast for roughly $5-$6 depending on the extra stuff you get. My dad and I ordered breakfast and I got an omelette and French toast to take home, all of which only cost $26.28. Absolute bargain and a Carlisle legend, if you’re ever in the area, definitely a great place to go.",Morgan Burns,3 reviews · 2 photos,2 years ago,5

HamiltonRestaurant,"Probably closer to 4 1/2 stars.  Food is always consistent and nice size portions.  Menu doesn't change as most of the daily ""specials"" are the same each day, or so it seems.  Salads are huge as are breakfast combos.  Steak sandwich is a slice of ribeye steak that extends about 4"" out from either side of the roll.  We usually look for Lisa as our waitress as she is super nice and very attentive.  Interesting dynamic between the servers and the kitchen, part of the show!  Would not hesitate ordering breakfast, a dinner or a sandwich.  Not the biggest fan, though, of their hot dogs, just doesn't have the same taste as other places but probably their most popular item.  Might be the only thing on the menu that I would not order on a regular basis but might once in a while.",steve malnick,55 reviews · 3 photos,2 years ago,4

HamiltonRestaurant,"The worst experience I have EVER had at the Hamilton.  I called in an order and the lady that answered the phone extremely unprofessional,mean with an attitude.  I ordered $70 worth of food which was ok.  When I said 3 hotchie dogs without the cheese she cut me off and said sir there called hot dogs not hotchie dogs.  hotchie has cheese the others are called just hot dogs.  Well I have been going to this place for 40 years, my family for 55 plus years atleast once a month or two and never have unheard that nor been treated that way.  I go to pick my order up and the lady that answered the phone said you must be the guy who called for hot dogs not hotchie dogs.  I said well sorry I never heard that before.  With an extremely stern voice and kinda loud that the whole place stopped and looked she said well next time you call in make sure you say the right thing.  I WAS LIKE WOW!!!.   my father has been ordering these this way for years....well hes wrong.  wow.  wait theres more.  An elderly lady who stood there saying hello hello mam can I pay my bill....the lady just looked at her and turned around and walked away.  The elderly turned and said this may be my last time coming in.  now by this time a man was asking for a shirt.  the waitress said to someone behind the counter..do we have anymore shirts?.  the younger girl said yes but I dont have time to go get him one. 😯.  the waitress was like ummm ok then and said sir sorry but we dont have any right now.

I am not sure if Tommy or Athan was there but I doubt it because I've never seen this before while they were working.  I am only giving this a 5 star because of all the other times I was there and there food was still great.  If this was my first time there I can honestly say it would of been my last and I probably would of just walked out.  I sure hope this doesn't happen again because this place will slowly go down hill.",Jeremy Ruff,7 reviews,a year ago,5

HamiltonRestaurant,"I came here because my coworkers raved about how this restaurant had some good food. I came here with a friend of mine. The food was okay. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either. What got me was the service. It was absolutely awful. I've never had a waitress treat us like we were the most disgusting things there. She practically threw the silverware towards us, didn't greet us, said, ""what do you want?"" and then pretty much threw the plate of food on the table too. When we had to check out, they told us that they didn't accept cards. Who doesn't accept cards at this day and age? We could barely pay since we didn't have much cash on us at that time. While we were trying to find more cash, this woman behind the cashier was smirking at us. Absolutely awful. I will not recommend this place no matter how long it's been there or how ""traditional"" it is. The staff there should be replaced. Even then, I will never go there again.",Lucinda Paeseworth,1 review,4 years ago,1
HamiltonRestaurant,"Usually this is one of our favorite place to eat. However, service was very slow today after we got our water. Our waitress was slow at taking our order and did not offer refill on my husband and daughter 's drinks. The restaurant wasn't super busy. Like I said this isn't the typical service at Hamilton. Don't let this one time discourage you. The food was GREAT as usual. We highly recommend this restaurant. Most of the staff is Awesome with very amazing service.",Thelma Kelley,1 review,6 years ago,3

HamiltonRestaurant,People that think this is a Hotspot has never gone outside their bubble. Dennys would easily outshine this place. Hot dogs are decent everything else bland and yuck. Not to mention they demand cash only no credit cards. What a joke this place is beyond sub par.  Not worth a star.  Will not return.,Andrew Phillips,63 reviews · 7 photos,2 years ago,1
HamiltonRestaurant,"Whenever you find a place where the locals go,you know the food is good.   This was our first time and the service was excellent and the food was delicious!  We like our food to come from the kitchen hot and that's the way it came.  A must stop if you go to Carlisle.

The staff always remember us, as well as our usual orders, and they always pay extra attention to our children (greeting them, asking how they are/how school is, asking them questions, etc) - the owner Tommy included!
The food is always delicious and you can't go wrong on anything you order. If you're new to this restaurant, be sure to try their all famous Hotchie-dog (hot chili cheese dog OR burger), gravy fries, and onion rings (hand battered and the BEST I've ever had)!!!",Janelle,Local Guide · 6 reviews,4 years ago,5

A small local crowd was scattered through the rest of the place from 7-8 on a Friday morning.  The prices are definitely fair for local diner food. The quality was everything you expect. The servers were friendly and mostly attentive to my coffee, though not my water. For sure recommended as a local diner.",Daniel Friess,Local Guide · 61 reviews · 312 photos,5 years ago,5

The food is delicious in my opinion, I usually get a Veggie Omelet with onions on my hashbrowns. I usually have to take some home because I get full. The environment is always busy, taking orders and bringing the orders out. It's actually nice to see that they pay attention to everyone who comes in. I will continue my monthly visits.",Nancy “Moon” Heuser,Local Guide · 26 reviews,5 years ago,5
HamiltonRestaurant,The Hamilton is a decent restaurant if you haven't tried the vanilla coke I highly recommend you try it they use real vanilla instead of the fake imitation vanilla the actual coke company uses and it makes a big difference and you can add the vanilla to other drinks too its a nice little dine in experience.,Ashley Cline,42 reviews · 13 photos,2 years ago,4

HamiltonRestaurant,"I went here in December 2014 one afternoon during the week. It was just okay. Food was good, but I found the atmosphere lacking. Maybe because I'm from out of town, or accustomed to larger metropolitan area restaurants... And, they don't take credit cards. I certainly did not get the feel of a 4.8 restaurant, which was their score when I looked for them during my visit.",Rodger Gettler,Local Guide · 43 reviews · 125 photos,9 years ago,3

HamiltonRestaurant,"This place was just what we were looking for on a rainy night. We didn't realize, but we walked in about 20 min before close (which I never do. I never walk into a restaurant so close to their closing time). Our server was sweet and helpful - she took the extra time to make our meal special. Everything was tasty and the pie is a must. There were so many options! My only complaint is that we didnt realize it was cash only until we walked up to the register (where there was a small sign that you wouldn't see just walking in) - they should have the servers say something before the order is taken....or get a credit card machine. Thankfully, there was an ATM about a block down the street - unfortunately it was raining Haha. Oh well - still a comfort food and nice people kind of place.",Alicia Santilli,Local Guide · 45 reviews · 28 photos,4 years ago,5

HamiltonRestaurant,"Worst experience in Carlisle Downtown. The old gentleman threw glasses of water and utensils on the table in a rude manner without saying hello or apologizing for almost spilling water on us. The food was 5/10, salad dressing was so oily that you couldn’t taste vegetable flavors, the steak was okay 7/10, pricy for regular quality, nothing especial. Only cash restaurant in 2021.

The hubby gets the feta and sausage omelette with home fries or the hatchie-dog (probably spelled 'hatchie' wrong) and Greek salad. The full menu is available all day. Do not miss the onion rings! All of this accompanied by the hardest working and nicest staff in Carlisle, PA. That says a lot because everywhere we have been has a nice staff. On street parking.

Had a Hot-chee burger and hot dog as I heard thats what I had to have if I was there from out of town.  Wasn't nearly up to the hype I had heard.  Servers were in a mad rush and pretty unfriendly to my table of folks.  Tossed stuff down and ran off.   Maybe it was due to most all tables being busy?

HamiltonRestaurant,"EVERYONE loves the Hamilton. I doubt anyone will be disappointed by choosing this restaurant. Home of the Hotchie Dog. For me, (just MY personal experience) it won't be a frequented restaurant because of the very small portions of soda, which you pay for by the glass (I am excessively thirsty by nature). I also can't eat the famous Hotchie Dogs or many of the items on the menu because I have Crohn's disease. This is just my personal situation.

It was just as cold as before so I said ""you know what? im ok"" she then knocked the fork out of my hand and grabbed my plate from me. Im serious. I had to tell her to get away from me.

CarlisleDiner,"Great diner experience.   Second time here.  First time was for breakfast and that was very good so we decided to try lunch here.  Was not disappointed!  My husband enjoyed his burger and I had a Cobb salad that was excellent.  My salad was so big I brought 1/2 home!  Chicken was fresh cooked and very tender.  I would highly recommend it.

CarlisleDiner,"The food here is OK. The atmosphere is pretty standard for a diner. However I did have a poor service experience. I asked for ice water and was brought a brown drink. Not sure what it was but when I informed the server that what I asked for was ice water they never took the brown drink away. Then they charged me for it. For reference it was just before 4pm Tuesday and maybe a total of 4 tables seated - not very busy. This place used to be good. After this experience,  I wouldn't recommend it.",Ray Torres,10 reviews,4 months ago,1

CarlisleDiner,"Been coming here annually and I’ll be honest, the quality of the food here has been amazing every time! From the pancakes to the over easy eggs to the corn beef hash! Carlisle Diner is a must go for anyone swinging through the area or just for a local bite!

Service is great and the atmosphere is just right to enjoy your morning cup of coffee and read the news.

Highly recommended for all age groups and ethnicities! Thank you for the great experience! Look forward to coming back!

CarlisleDiner,The young girl at the front made it a little unwelcoming because she kept complaining  about someone not marking the seating chart. Other than that our waitress was awesome.

CarlisleDiner,The food was very good. The eggs and bacon were cooked perfectly and the coffee was really good. Our waitress was efficient but she could have been a lot friendlier.

CarlisleDiner,I ordered food that was on their online menu and not only didn’t they inform me they didn’t have it but they also got snotty when I told them they gave me the wrong thing and I had to order something else. I would give them a one star but I know they can do better and always have when I’ve been in there. I hope this is a one off incident and others don’t share in it as I love this place. The food is great the prices are ok and the atmosphere inside is good also the staff is usually very friendly. I’ve been going for years and it’s the first time I’ve experienced this. I hope they server everyone else better and your experiences are what I know they can provide.,Trav Sheaffer,6 reviews · 2 photos,4 years ago,2

CarlisleDiner,Place has gone WAY downhill. Food and service both. 2 meals at different times a month apart were nearly inedible. Too many other places around to sit through food this bad anymore.,Tom Murry,Local Guide · 139 reviews · 15 photos,a month ago,2
CarlisleDiner,The food can be described as mediocre at best. The wait staff seated a group of people with ill behaviors children in the middle of grown adults who were just trying to have a quiet meal. The children were so out of control that customers started asking to be moved to other sections.,Nancy Cates,Local Guide · 40 reviews · 20 photos,7 months ago,1
CarlisleDiner,"As a former employee and consumer, this place is all around amazing.  The food is usually always fresh, fairly priced and the employees are usually very friendly.

Though I do feel one employee there deserves a plaque, honor party, maybe even parade for his absolutely amazing work ethic, attitude and dedication.  Is probably one of the kindest people I have ever had the pleasure of working with and watch work there for as long as I can remember coming here.

If you have been there, then you already know who I am talking about!

Anyway, back to the food.  They really work hard and put love into the food and I haven't come across any food I have disliked so far (besides stuff I already don't like so that doesn't count)!

Will always be my top choice of diners to eat at in Carlisle!",Lisa,Local Guide · 43 reviews · 152 photos,11 months ago,5

We had to have food given back 3 times to be corrected and we had to ask for multiple items that we ordered that were ""forgot."" He was completely unprofessional and should do better at his job. Everything I had to go look for him, he was hiding in a little corner in the front of the restaurant with his hands in his pockets! It will be a long time until I come back for dinner unless it's a Friday when I can request good service!",Sasha Jaime,8 reviews,9 months ago,1

CarlisleDiner,"Recently under new ownership, however not much has changed here.
Breakfast and late night bar closing is probably best suited for visiting.
What you would expect in a lower-cost diner.  Exterior weeds and cigarette butts are detracting and the worn, dingy interior and greasy atmosphere does not help.  Food is so-so and servers are nice, but often forget to bring drinks, bring wrong order, etc..  I hope they can get their act together here and clean this place up as we need a diner on this side of town, but I'm not crossing my fingers.",Douglas Kauffman,Local Guide · 52 reviews · 96 photos,4 months ago,4
CarlisleDiner,"I used to really love this place, but it seems like lately they've been hiring absolute potatoes as servers. Had a gentleman named Christian the past few times I've been in. Last time i was in he forgot my coleslaw (which is included with my wrap) and this time he forgot my friend's coleslaw and my salad. Along with the blue cheese i ordered with my appetizer. The dude doesn't pay attention and seems to not be familiar with the menu. I swear Jess and Kim were the only two servers that actually know what they're doing in the past year or two. I used to be a regular but this is disappointing anymore.",anthony gehman,Local Guide · 119 reviews · 23 photos,4 years ago,1

CarlisleDiner,The food was good.. The breakfast special definitely filled me up for the rest of the day.  Typical weak diner coffee though.  Refills of coffee and water were prompt. Service was adequate but not friendly.  We were seated next to the dirty dishes and silverware trolley.  A bit disgusting considering the Rubbermaid cart needs a good power wash.  It must have been a very busy breakfast because the carpets were pretty dirty everywhere.  However I enjoyed my food.  Maybe we caught them at a bad time.  We'll try them again.,Michael Kadjeski,Local Guide · 119 reviews,a year ago,4

CarlisleDiner,I'm not sure how this diner get a 4.2 rating in reviews. The food was just ok and the place looked dirty. The carpet looks like it was from the revolutionary war. There were paper's from straws all over the floor next to food that had been dropped. There was a vacuum standing in a corner (that certainly is something you want to look at while you're eating) it just looked like it hadn't been used in a long time. The waitress was very nice.,Raymond Vagg,5 reviews,a year ago,1

CarlisleDiner,"Tried a little bit of everything because their menu was eclectic.  I had the fish and chips, which were very crispy and not overwhelming ""fishy"".  Their tartar sauce was very well balanced as well. My boyfriend got the rodeo burger which had a nice crust on the patty and wasn't overloaded with sauce.  He also got a ham and cheese omelet which was tasty... with sausage links which were really good, very well seasoned.  All in all was a great diner experience",Lisa Malin,6 reviews · 5 photos,2 years ago,5
CarlisleDiner,"apparently finding a good diner in central pa is somewhat of a challenge if you are ""spoiled"" by NY/NJ or touristy areas. I can say this one is a great find although its a bit far from our usual travels, but surely would be a stop when we in Carlisle or passing through next time. Prices are very reasonable. Both Gyro and Beef Liver we ordered was excellent. Fries was the amongst the best we've had as well as well mixed house coleslaw and New England clam chowder I had as a starter.

CarlisleDiner,"Went there for dinner date before a movie with my wife.  If giving school grades, I would have to give a B.  Service and food was good.  Wasn't very busy, but at check out, I had pointed out to the waitress that the way something looked on the check wasn't quite right and she said the way she wrote the money sign didn't connect correctly to the amount.  Lo and behold, the check out girl read it the way I read it and charged me the wrong amount.  Luckily the manager was there and voided it and put the correct amount.  I still can only give this place four stars.  I wish I could have given more, but I am still not trusting this place entirely.",Andres Bodon,Local Guide · 28 reviews,10 months ago,4
CarlisleDiner,"This was a very good place. The place was clean, lots to choose from on the menu, breakfast served all day and the service was fantastic!

CarlisleDiner,"Great customer service,  our waitress was amazing and on top of her game.  The reason for 4 stars is because my original order ended up being disgusting, not at all what I expected, but they replaced my meal with no questions and I wasn't even charged for the original order!

CarlisleDiner,"The diner itself was very good.  It was clean, service was fast and friendly, and the food was very good.

However, the clientele in this place .... not always so great.  I was seated next to a group of older teens who were cursing and having a downright disgusting conversation.

I had to ask to be moved.

Because of this, I recommend the Walnut Bottom Diner instead.  I have been there many times and have never been seated near a raucous and rude group such as this.",Kristine PFS,Local Guide · 110 reviews · 2 photos,4 years ago,3

He enjoyed it.  I had the farmers omelet minus the shrooms and it came just as ordered.  It could have been hotter.  It wasn’t  cold but just warm.  The home fries were yummy.  The waitress lacked personality and friendliness but she was efficient.  Aside from giving me rye instead of white toast",GayeLynn Maron,Local Guide · 18 reviews · 34 photos,3 years ago,3

CarlisleDiner,I can meet some friends here as customers or staff. I like the Alpine omlette and coffee. You can call in your order and pick it up at the drive up window. Remember it's a diner and they do take about 15 to 20 minutes to make some foods. The men's restroom does not seem to be part of the heat/cooling so it can be chilly or stuffy depending on the season. Out door seating is on a deck that is rather new(have not tried it yet).,David Myers,Local Guide · 9 reviews,2 years ago,5

Opens at 5am which is great for people like me who start their day early.
I like the weekday breakfast special. For like $3 you can get eggs, toast and home fries. Awesome. Add coffee and tip and you have a great inexpensive breakfast. They have lots of other specials in the board daily too.
Food was good. Potatoes a little bland and kind of tasted frozen or something. I'll order them well done next time.
Staff was great, even early in the morning. Lots of attention and always there to refill your coffee.

CarlisleDiner,We were there at 12:30 pm for lunch. Waitress very slow. Talking to another patron. Had to ask another waitress for boxes and bill. They give you very large unwanted portions. Even though we chose from the senior menu. The restaurant was not busy at all. Food was good there was just too much for a person to eat at one sitting. I had a ham slice that was enough for 3 people!! Only my husband's portion was for one person. Parents had chicken and waffles that they had to take home. Would not be my favorite place to eat.,Kathy Bateson,85 reviews,4 years ago,3

CarlisleDiner,"The prices are definitely catered to the college kids. I've never been to a diner before where replacing one item could hike up the bill for the price of a drink. Homefries are free to replace for french fries anywhere else you go.

Don't come here expecting fair prices on anything with how underwhelming the menu options are. (Who doesn't put the time to have have a decent breakfast menu) The prices are def more than your average diner, you could easily get more food going elsewhere for the same price.

Beyond that, decent staff and atmosphere.",SoundCaster,Local Guide · 49 reviews · 65 photos,4 years ago,3

CarlisleDiner,"Laid back diner.  Good place for a breakfast.  Fast service and good food.  Not good by my tastes for lunch or supper, since I need my French fries. The French fries were horrible greasy slop the three times I tried it.  Loud people make it fun and amusing to hear gossip there.",Carolyn King,57 reviews · 19 photos,6 years ago,4
CarlisleDiner,Alot of different employees. Most will put splenda and cream in your coffie to go. But a few will put little packets that go all over the car in a bag and hand more trash out. If you do drive up you are xtra collateral customers. Not a main focus. Foods good and good quality though. Good servings.,Mike Thomas,7 reviews,a year ago,3

CarlisleDiner,"Stopped by here because a member of our party was under 21 and couldn't get into the gingerbread man to eat after 9pm. We were hoping for classic diner food, but ended up getting condiments that had been sitting out for hours and day-old bacon. As we left, we saw them putting the next day's bacon on the grill. Out of 5 people's orders, the only appetizing dish was the pancakes.",Thomas Lord,Local Guide · 22 reviews · 13 photos,5 years ago,1
CarlisleDiner,"I waited for about 4 minutes before being seated despite making eye contact with multiple employees, and when I was about to leave the server was really aggressive on whether or not I was staying. When I was paying my server asked if I wanted to leave a tip on my card or on the table which made me feel put on the spot like I had to give a really good tip.  I also overheard another customer say that the food he got was soggy because the cook put his toast on something like a sauce and he was pretty upset about it. Most of my experiences here have been pretty bad lately and I probably will not be eating here for quite some time.",Randal Oxford,Local Guide · 63 reviews · 77 photos,5 years ago,2
CarlisleDiner,"We always love coming to the diner, especially when we’re in a hurry. The servers are attentive and friendly. However, we got sat tonight by a rude, unhospitable host. He persisted on seating three grown men at a small table and when we requested a larger table he continue to argue with us. He stated that because we were not a large party we could not sit a larger table. Mind you this was 8:30 at night and no one was there. Very poor customer service and very rude host. He needs to learn hospitality more before getting to interact with customers.",Erin Newcomer,1 review,5 years ago,2
CarlisleDiner,"A cornerstone of the town. I've been coming here for at least 15 years. I'm a breakfast anytime if day person, and they never disappoint. The salads are huge, bring your appetite.

CarlisleDiner,Today I had to be asked three times if anyone was getting my drink order even though I was asked and I relayed what I wanted as soon as I was seated.  It took awhile for a refill on my coffee and a simple order of a hot dog and a wrap took longer than expected during a non rush hour time frame.

CarlisleDiner,"Food was good as usual. I stop in here a couple times a month and it has been a long time since I was disappointed in the server. Took my order for chicken broccoli Alfredo with mashed potatoes, and a side salad. When I was served I received everything but the salad. I know that anyone can forget and would have taken it with me or maybe just a quick apology. None of that was done. She wrote out a new ticket that did not have the side salad with no tomatoes and French dressing. This is not how you should be treating any customer. I know what was ordered and gave her a chance to make it right.",Dave Myers,Local Guide · 6 reviews,5 years ago,2

CarlisleDiner,9/2012~~The Carlisle Diner is a hometown place.  Good breakfasts at reasonable prices even with today's economy.  Lunch is good and french fries are always hot.  Some places they are sitting around all day and cold when served.  My hubby loves the senior meals...the broiled fish is huge.  I love the hamburgers!  You can get a small Greek salad which is good.  Many choices on the menu.  We just came back from FL and SC and down south it is very hard to find a local/ family owned restaurant.  So we appreciate all the family owned diners in PA.  The reason I gave 4 stars is the cole slaw was spoiled!  Serving staff should always check that. It comes in a tiny container already packaged.,Chris Witmer,Local Guide · 159 reviews,6 years ago,4
CarlisleDiner,"Dirty carpets, irritated workers and atrosious service. Ok, they're are only two servers working at 3:19 am on Saturday night. But, I've been here for 42 mins and they just put my order in while I'm writing this. Workers are more concerned with being  caughtup in love affairs with customers than their position. Yeah. Horrible experience. I'd really like to leave but, ... Oh goodness, they are now telling me that they don't have grits smh. SMH",Decadent Enterprise,3 reviews,4 years ago,1

CarlisleDiner,Came on a sunday morning and it was pretty busy yet I still got my food in less time then I had expected. Waitresses are always very friendy.

Not one negative to say about Carlisle Diner.,Brian Eichelberger,3 reviews,5 years ago,5
CarlisleDiner,This is one of just numerous diners in Carlisle. All of them have the same basic menu. And the same low level of cleanliness. These diner specializes in the 2 AM a post drinking greasy food and not much more. The waitstaff is overworked and under paid. The waitresses usually have short tempers because the people who dine here aren’t the most polite and professional.

JohnsHideawayRestaurant,"We really enjoyed dinner here tonight. My grandparents came here all the time, and so when I was in town I wanted to check the place out.  I had the lamb gyro and rice pudding and both were wonderful. The baked flounder and macaroni and cheese looked great too. They also have cheese steaks and gyros which aren't listed on the menu. Everything seemed home-cooked and there is a very friendly home-town vibe here. We'll definitely be back.",Amanda Mcneil,Local Guide · 125 reviews · 447 photos,2 years ago,5

JohnsHideawayRestaurant,"Prices are very reasonable, but the food isn't all that great. They have a ""vegetables"" section in the menu that should be renamed ""sides"" because the list has almost no vegetables on it. We did not enjoy the corn or the broccoli salad. The meatloaf and hamburger steak were decent, but nothing was really worth coming back for. We normally go to Hickory Ridge, but they were closed today.",Maria Wright,58 reviews · 15 photos,4 months ago,3

Great food,  great service,  and they treat everyone like they're family.  There's a reason that they have been around forever.  The only drawback is that there isn't any real of street parking,  but it's worth circling the block to find a spot.  In Carlisle for the week,  weekend,  or a day?

Highly recommend",Angie Rae,6 reviews,2 years ago,5
JohnsHideawayRestaurant,"I am from North Carolina. I have met some my of my best friends in Carlisle Pa.at the car show. This year we found this wonderful restaurant,  We have went by it many times on the way to the show. We finished our trip there this year and it was a wonderful experience. The atmosphere is amazing, The place is cozy and very clean, The food is fantastic with reasonable prices. The folks there are the best. Our waitress Kathy took fantastic care of us. The Owner came out and talked to us. If you are in the Carlisle area do not settle for less. This place is definitely a hidden gem!!!! I hate it took us 30 years to find this beautiful Restaurant!!!!",Randy Treadway,2 reviews · 7 photos,2 years ago,5

JohnsHideawayRestaurant,We visit Lancaster County every year from the UK and love trying new restaurants and diners with our American friends..  we will never step foot in Johnny's Hideaway Restaurant.  We would advise others to visit the Restroom BEFORE sitting down to eat.,Jean Jeffrey,4 reviews,a year ago,1
JohnsHideawayRestaurant,"So at first glance you might think this place isn't worth it, but you'd be wrong. Look. There are no modern frills. It feels like an old diner, complete with a menu with things like liver & onions and fried ham, and a clientele which has been coming here for decades. And if you just looked at that, what with ""diners"" nowadays being all fancy, and what we used to call regular food now out of fashion, you would miss that the food is home cooked, the staff are welcoming, and the locals are filled with the best stories. Sure the menu is no frills, but it's delicious. I think we lose some of that simplicity in modern restaurants. Everything nowadays is deconstructed or has a name you can't pronounce, which don't get me wrong I like on many occasions. But there's a place for simplicity. And this place....This stuff is grandma proud, good ol comfort food. You want some of the best meatloaf or fried chicken ever, sitting among locals rip roaring it up in an extremely casual environment at a good price? This is it, and I hope it stays. Otherwise, we lose the refined elegance in simple, home cooked food, which is something no town should be without. And PS, if you really want to hear some great banter, head in around 6am. Those folks have THE best time, and the sausage is the best in town.",Crystal Oakman,Local Guide · 38 reviews · 4 photos,6 years ago,5
JohnsHideawayRestaurant,This place is a hidden gem!!! The homemade sausage was incredible and the pancakes are as fluffy as a pillow. As a homefries lover these ones hit the mark(well done of course). I can't wait to try the dinner tonight 😋😊☺ …,Brett Toomes,Local Guide · 26 reviews · 46 photos,3 years ago,5
JohnsHideawayRestaurant,"First time going here & took my family out for lunch & we were very disappointed. My Fiancé ordered the Turkey Sub with Mayo , onions & lettuce NO TOMOATOES & when the server brought the Sub tomatoes where on the Sub. The turkey was dry & had mold inside & it was absolutely disgusting. We also ordered the Mozzarella sticks & the cheese explosed everywhere & some pieces had no cheese in it the Marinara sauce smelled like metal. We are definitely won't be going back",Daniel Mentzer,15 reviews,a year ago,1

JohnsHideawayRestaurant,9/2012~~This is another Carlisle institution.  Been around for many years.  Nothing fancy and the menu/decor hasn't changed in years.  Don't let that stop you from eating here.  Food is fresh prepared when you order...fries are always hot...not laying under a heat lamp.  Wonderful real turkey sandwiches. Fresh cole slaw and broccoli salad.  John's has lost a lot of business due to the closing of Tire and Wheel so I hope in the future after something replaces Tire and Wheel business will pick up again.  Many loyal customers eat here.,Chris Witmer,Local Guide · 159 reviews,11 years ago,4

FaysCountryKitchen,"We enjoyed our stop here.  We don't live in the area and saw this place was highly rated. I really loved the decor, which was red, white and black and lots of Coca-Cola memorabilia. The waitresses were very pleasant and friendly. The food choices were good on the menu and they had breakfast after noon, which is always a big plus for me. The reason I didn't go with five stars was that I felt it was a little dirtier than I like to see in a food establishment. Also, my baked oatmeal was very dry and unappealing. I got it with fruit in it and the fruit was almost non existent and dried up as well. My husband was unhappy that there were upcharges for small things, such as rye toast.

All in all, we're glad we stopped simply because it seems to be a mainstay of the town of Carlisle and it was kind of a blast from the past, which is always nice.",Gina Marie Acker,"Local Guide · 432 reviews · 1,662 photos",11 months ago,4
FaysCountryKitchen,"Stopped here quick while in the area. The waitresses way of greeting me was “you can sit wherever”. She was not friendly or inviting whatsoever. I ordered a bacon skillet and it hard hardly any bacon in it- mostly just potato and cheese. I mentioned it to the waitress and she said she’d say something to the cook but never did. Instead she walked over to her coworker and  I heard her snickering “well he finished the plate so it must not be that bad”. Very disappointed in the professionalism and service, I won’t be stopping here again.",Laz Cabrera,4 reviews,a month ago,1
FaysCountryKitchen,The food is processed such as the frozen hockey puck burgers.  Processed French fries.  Lousy food.  Processed meat on a Rueben sandwich.  We expected a better quality meal.

FaysCountryKitchen,Enjoyed the experience here because I liked the atmosphere and the food. According to our waitress said they are known for their skillets and pecan pancakes. I ordered the fiesta skilled eggs over easy with raisin bread and 1 pecan pancake. My wife ordered the special (see picture). Our waitress was very attentive in spite of being busy and the food came out hot and fresh. The price and quality beat most places locally. The decorations are fun and a throwback with lots of old coke product stuff. They also have hand sanitizer at each table.,Thomas Boyd,Local Guide · 262 reviews · 621 photos,2 years ago,5
FaysCountryKitchen,"I loved my skillet meal. Hubby is spoiled by Perkins pancakes so he wasn't too excited.  But I would definitely go back. I must say though, that they had the BEST coffee I've EVER had in a restaurant.  It was SO good.

FaysCountryKitchen,"A landmark in one of my stories that I adapted from my life. In the story I attended breakfast with my sister and her boyfriend and Amy and her father Andrew. In the story my sister brings up the topic of my ex-g/f Katie, and her boyfriend says eeks nay on the Katie nay, as Katie and I just broke up.

In the real world Fay's was popular amongst Dickinson students, and I remember ordering a breakfast skillet.",Matt Gioia,9 reviews,4 months ago,5

FaysCountryKitchen,"I don’t understand all the positive reviews, I was not impressed with this restaurant. I really wanted to like it and tried it several times before leaving this review, but it’s slightly below average. Waitress had an attitude and shouldn’t be in the hospitality business. Coffee was terrible, ordered an egg skillet with sausage and needed a magnifying glass to find any sausage in it. My daughter wanted her egg without the yoke and though they said they crack their own eggs, they didn’t know how to separate the yoke from the whites. Really? I’m clumsy in the kitchen and can still preform this basic task. Will not be returning and do not recommend this place.",J N,55 reviews · 19 photos,8 months ago,2

We always look forward to our next time that we are able to go.,Douglas Gonze,25 reviews,a year ago,5
FaysCountryKitchen,"Poor service.  The place was crowded when I arrived and my name was placed on a list, and I waited.  I was asked if I would like to sit at the counter and I said ""no"" since I have a back issue and cannot do so.

About 20 minutes later I was told that my only option would be the counter.

They should have said that right from the start so I did not waste 20 minutes waiting for a table they had no intention of providing.

Thumbs down, poor form.

I went to Walnut Bottom Diner instead.  I was seated there immediately, and received friendly service.  I highly recommend Walnut Bottom Diner as an alternative to Fay's Country Kitchen.",Sapphire Ludlow,2 reviews,11 months ago,1
FaysCountryKitchen,"Came to grab a little brunch after the gym! Very good food for a price you typically don’t come across nowadays! Speaking of which, as a heads up, this is a cash only place! They do have an ATM. For food, I got the Western Omelette - substituted the onions with mushrooms. The egg tasted pretty good, not dry at all, I did add a tad more salt. The home fries were pretty potato-y for me. The toast was amazing, nicely buttered! The other dish was the Fiesta Skillet. My boyfriend said it fits his tastebuds perfect.",Jessica Zheng,Local Guide · 86 reviews · 116 photos,a year ago,4

She acted like she didn't want to be there, disappeared continuously, and dropped our check off with our food, not even coming back to see how everything was or if we needed anything. She never gave us her name, so I couldn't suggest how to avoid having her as your server.

Will definitely come back again,Devin Burr,Local Guide · 127 reviews · 22 photos,a year ago,5
FaysCountryKitchen,Local Gem! Fay's is an integral part of Carlisle. They are one of the few breakfast places that serve skillets. The Fiest Skillet is my favorite. I travel down from Enola once a month for a skillet. One other great thing is that they are cash only. I miss that in a world that is working towards going cashless. There is a fair amount of seating for a local joint. Street parking surrounds the restaurant. I have not delved deeply into the remainder of the menu though I am sure it is tasty. Their skillets are my thing. There are quite a many diners in Carlisle. Fay's stands out with old world charm. Check it out!,David Hervey,Local Guide · 121 reviews · 162 photos,a year ago,5

These people were very accommodating and with minimal wait we had two tables cleaned, pulled together & our orders were taken. We had everything from a muffin and a coke, strawberry pancakes, garden omelette, ham egg & cheese on a bagel & a meatloaf skillet. All were reasonably priced and very good.

FaysCountryKitchen,"We’re visiting my son at Dickinson College and tried Fay’s Country Kitchen for breakfast. Although there was a line when we arrived, it moved quickly. The people were very friendly and attentive. Sally took great care of us. I had the skillet with bacon and cheese. They both had bacon egg and cheese on bagels with hash browns on the side.

FaysCountryKitchen,"Went there with my wife and kid. The food was Luke warm when we got it, was pretty tasteless and could tell it had been sitting for awhile. The server was not very friendly didnt ask if the food was ok.....guess she knew it sucked already. The hostess was unfriendly as well with a gigantic chip on her shoulder.  I don't get why they have good reviews. Just another restaurant using all pre-made foods from Sysco or what have you.
What a waste of hard earned money....so sad",Brian Ducary,Local Guide · 49 reviews · 19 photos,a year ago,1
FaysCountryKitchen,"Amazing food and atmosphere! I always get the same thing and it's perfect every time, I highly recommend the strawberry stuffed French toast. It's made with fresh strawberries.

The breakfast food is absolutely wonderful- I could eat their French toast and hash browns all day! My only critique is that the restaurant is CASH ONLY which is a little inconvenient for people like myself. On my latest visit, I had forgot their policy and was short $3 in cash-- but a very nice man sitting near the register stepped in and paid for the rest of my breakfast! It was so sweet and made my day.",Jo Jo,Local Guide · 73 reviews,6 years ago,5

FaysCountryKitchen,"We arrived at 11:30, as always the restaurant was pretty full so we sat at the counter, at 11:40 our order was taken, nothing crazy just breakfast.  At 12:10 (30 minutes later) our food had not yet arrived our server apologized and said someone from the kitchen had called off. 12:15 still no breakfast at 12:20 (now 40 minutes since order was taken) still no breakfast at 12:25 Brad is ready to walk out. I asked to speak to someone/anyone in charge, request ignored. A few minutes later our food arrived. Not all that good.
Servers had a tendency to gather around soda machine as a break area or waiting for their orders, loud at times. Our cokes were flat, how many servers does it take to correct the carbonation...5. Not once but twice. In addition to  our wait what was very disappointing were the other servers (which by the way should have nametags). Not once did another server ask us if we needed anything or offer to see what was taking so long. In fact we were ignored. Eye contact avoided. There was one server in particular (dark hair with bangs) who may or may not have been in charge she had an attitude, blatantly ignored us and avoided eye contact. Our server and the young girl helping bus tables, wrap silverware were awesome. I realize that there was  a Truck show at the fairgrounds and I understand someone called off but to you servers...its the little things that matter and get you your tips.",Pixxy,1 review,2 years ago,1

We got served our OJ right away and seated when we got there. If you are looking for a get in and get out type of breakfast joint, McDonald's is where you should go.  To be able to sit with friends and family and to take in the views and enjoy each other while waiting for your food makes it that much more of an enjoyable experience.

FaysCountryKitchen,"I decided to get breakfast here before making my long walk home. I walked in, nobody acknowledged me. I remembered that the place was cash only so I got some cash out of the ATM and sat down. One employee walked over and handed me a menu and just said ""Let me know when your ready."" I nodded, looked at the menu and placed an order. My food came out and everything tasted dry and lacked any real flavor, like everything had been overcooked. I got scrambled eggs, bacon and homefries. None of it tasted good at all...What bothers me is noone who was there seemed to care like they were just there for the sake of being there, that is not a good impression to give a customer. To be fair, food service is hard. People are usually underpaid, under appreciated and live pay-check to paycheck and only able to get the really important things based on what they make off of tips. I do food service..., but I am never coming back here. My boss would have been all over the entire team for looking like we don't care. I didn't even want to take my food with me, it was so dry and flavorless. I've been living in Carlisle for about 10 years and I've been to pretty much every resturant atleast once.

FaysCountryKitchen,"Stopped in for breakfast on a Friday about 11.  Nice clean dining area, decor is 100% Coca-Cola if you're into that kind of thing.  Omelet and corned beef hash were very good and came quickly.  Only issue was, I asked for Swiss cheese on my omelet and was told they ""don't have it for omelets"" which I assumed meant they don't have it.  When I checked out, I made a comment that I found it odd they didn't have any.  The cashier told me they had it, but it gets ""too confusing on weekends"" and they only have one kind of cheese for omelets.  I questioned how that applied to me, and she was quite flippant, telling me ""if I listened I would have understood"".  Needless to say, even though it was a pleasant and tasty meal, I WILL NOT BE BACK!  Perhaps they should hire some more competent staff so different cheese on an omelet doesn't cause too much chaos and rudeness.  Weirdest excuse I ever got in a diner.",John Kownacki,11 reviews · 3 photos,4 years ago,3
FaysCountryKitchen,"One of those places where there's a collection of Coca Cola paraphenalia that was actually collected by the proprietor, not just purchased as decor; and where a group of locals meets up for breakfast every Tuesday morning.

FaysCountryKitchen,They have the best breakfast I have ever eaten. I was in town for a bit. My mother-in-law brought me here. Plus I'm a Coke decor freak. Wow Coke decor all over.

FaysCountryKitchen,"Our favorite Carlisle restaurant for breakfast. First sit down meal after living in Germany for 5 years and glad we chose Fay’s. Food was fresh, coffee strong, and no issues with supporting a good clean COVID free restaurant.

( not a big deal people, I saw a lot a critisism on that) Server was very understanding when I pointed it out.

FaysCountryKitchen,"Good place for breakfast, although seating can be a little tight. Popular with younger crowd , especially on weekends. Food is good and priced fairly,.

FaysCountryKitchen,"FULL FLAVORS & FULL COLORS!!
In this compact and distinct 19C American town and thriving ( which is rare! ), I stumbled into this dinner surround with adoringly decorated walls and they were well done and beautiful. But I was even happier when I was served their breakfast. Scrapple was square and crisp outside, eggs were golden yellow, nicely browned fries and the full flavored slices of rye bread. I needed nothing more.
But the best was the staffs who are sweet, friendly and kind whole time busy serving and cleaning.
Thank you!!!!",M. Paul Iwao,Local Guide · 30 reviews · 11 photos,4 years ago,5
FaysCountryKitchen,I eat out alot. When we walked in it was so loud and congested. Breakfast should be waking up calming. I was not impressed. Beware Vicki needs to get with the times.

FaysCountryKitchen,"Stopped on a Tuesday around 10AM. Would not choose to stop again. Ham looked nice but tasted a bit sour like it was getting ready to turn. Used mustard to mask the flavor. Home fries good, except I was given onions on them after I had declined the offer to add onions.  Waitress checked her order pad while she stood there to make sure about no onions (uncomfortable). Rye toast cut thinner than regular and costs 25c upcharge.  Jelly bin was completely full of grape only.   The toast was barely browned, and was soaked with bright yellow butter-flavored griddle oil, even though I asked for peanut butter instead.  Then I was charged 50c for a tiny plastic cup of PB.

Why charge your customers for something different, especially when the competition doesn’t?  Upcharges are customer repellent, especially when the patron makes a choice because you are out of something they would have liked.  I didn’t charge for my personal time while I sat there waiting to have my potatoes corrected, as my wife ate her breakfast without me.

Pancakes had a gummy consistency, not fluffy as buttermilk should be.  Scrambled eggs were brownish and flat, maybe the eggs were mixed a while ago. Bacon was dense and pressed perfectly flat except one corner folded over hard, like reheated from previously cooked and at the bottom of the stack of cooked meat. Orange juice OK.  Coffee good. Restaurant was clean. Portions good. Wait staff good and stay out front. We received a bill without the total added up.

So the food is not freshly cooked, except the sunny eggs. Service fine, but we were only one of about four tables. If there is not much business, why not cook fresh?  This is why we stopped, and will not bother again.  Eating out should be special for guests instead of being convenient for the cooks.",Paul Taylor,4 reviews · 11 photos,4 years ago,2

FaysCountryKitchen,"Let me tell you about the gateway to heaven starting with the pancakes, I have traveled the world and had food from all over. Hands down the best pancakes I have ever had. My car broke down from a very long trip from the mid west and had a pretty bad morning, the second I walked in the angels of the restaurant world smiled upon me with The Peanut Butter Cup Pancakes and took me for a ride through each fluffy layer of pancakes that made me go from frown to fiesta. I would have my car “have issues” again just to have an excuse to indulge myself in Nirvana. I would give more stars if I could.

FaysCountryKitchen,"9/2012~~Fay's is a local eatery started many years ago by the Witmers.  (now owned by someone else)  We have not eaten there in years.  The reason being, the food is never hot..not even luke warm. (the opposite when the Witmer's owned it...no relation) They have the best pancakes around but who wants cold pancakes/breakfast.  No warmer in the kitchen??  The service is slow and half the time the waitresses forget about their customers.  Getting a second cup of coffee is by luck only. (I used to get my own coffee from the coffee/silverware station in the place)   Yes, the place is loud but it is an old car dealership building with huge windows in the front.

KimberlysCafeAndCreamery,"Delicious food, reasonable prices and good portions, plus a friendly and helpful server! I got lunch here (which I didn’t even know they had)— an autumn turkey delight sandwich and my friend got a Dickinson salad, both of which tasted great and were quite filling! They also had wraps, burgers, other speciality sandwiches and salads, miscellaneous lunch appetizers, and soups. The fries I ordered with my sandwich were even fresh house cut ones. The place is kind of small, but it’s cozy and makes for a nice place to hang out or grab lunch with a few friends. Would definitely come back :)",Emily Moody,3 reviews · 5 photos,9 months ago,5

KimberlysCafeAndCreamery,"This is the second time I did Thanksgiving Turkey Takeout and I must say what a difference a year makes.   The prior year it was hot, delicious and you would have thought it was all
homemade,.  This year did a 360 turn and it was down right awful for the big bucks paid for my family’s meal.   The platters came out cold…. If I would have known this I would not have ordered.   The gravy wasn’t anything like Turkey gravy at all …. It was as bright as a yellow school bus and had so many lumps …. It  look like ski mogul bumps…. Not something worth eating. I was so excited not to be cooking again this year and was looking forward to supporting a local business that had the best food just a year before.    I don’t know what changed but I can do I am absolutely done with this restaurant.  Never Again!",Linda L,4 reviews,a year ago,1

Very good service, never hard to get someone's attention if there's a problem because the place is so small and service is very attentive.  Food is good, and if it there's a problem with it, they'll fix it for you.   Restrooms are kept up, parking lot is small but adequate.  It's near the local college, with lots of foot traffic, so be careful of pedestrians when you're backing up and pulling out of their lot.",Pam Rotella,Local Guide · 144 reviews · 1 photo,2 years ago,5

Bigelow tea is served in many flavors and you don't pay for more than 1 teabag like so many places. Coffee is disappointing, usually very weak.

KimberlysCafeAndCreamery,"I walk by this place more often than I can remember...The building and the businesses name never really caught my interest, but one day as I’m walking through town early in the morning. I decide to walk and have breakfast. I did not have any real expectations...Like I said Kimberly’s Cafe & Creamery has not caught my attnention nor has anyone I know ever told me about it.

I go in, I order pancakes, scrapple and a drink. I sit and wait for about twenty minutes which is not too far outside normal waiting time. The waitress brings me a plate of the food I order and my drink. The pancakes seemed undercooked if not doughy on the inside. (The texture of the pancakes felt like a wet napkin...) , but if that was not bad enough. I cannot describe the Scrapple I ordered and to top it all off the drink (Soda) I ordered was very flat. I told the waitress who apologized then came back with another drink (Which did not taste any better) Then she walks buy and brings me another soda (I did not ask for) and the flatness of that drink was worse than the first one.

The only good thing I have to say about this place is the waitress who handled my order was friendly and apologized...repeatedly. Also, she did not charge me for the two extra drinks she brought me so at least I did not have to pay extra for something I did not want or ask for...

Normally I put more effort into writing regardless of what I’m writing, but as I’m writing this. I really don’t care...maybe I’ll edit it later, but this review is barely worth my time. I’m just writing it because i am a local guide through google...",Deldius Centurion,Local Guide · 23 reviews,5 years ago,1
KimberlysCafeAndCreamery,Kim has a menu full of delicious food. Today I enjoyed the sesame chicken salad with lemon poppy seed bread. The bread was included! I also took home two pieces of apple pie. She baked the bread. I want the recipe. It was so moist and yummy.,Tracy Slaybaugh,3 reviews,5 years ago,5
KimberlysCafeAndCreamery,"This was by far the worst experience I’ve ever had. I walked in with my boyfriend for breakfast and waited 20 mins before being sat. The waitress stared us down and kept about her business until she decided she was ready to seat us (mind you there were only four other tables in the restaurant). Once we were seated, she threw the menus down on the table and walked away without saying a word. I had to call her back over to get our drink order and then she asked if we were ready and I told her no. We were o my ready for the drink order. She walked over to the kitchen and screamed back to the cook, “No, THEY aren’t ready.” At this point, I stood up and told her that we were leaving. I don’t know if it was because we were LGBT, people of color, or a combination of the two. If you are any of these, don’t go here unless you want to subject yourself to terrible service and unfriendly staff.",Brandon Riojas,Local Guide · 16 reviews · 1 photo,5 years ago,1

GrandmaStamms,"Excellent smash burgers if you like smash burgers. Wonderful Mac and cheese. Through calling in my order we had a mix up on the order but they fixed it for free and my boss got to try their breakfast smash burger for free. Excellent customer service, fair pricing and a huge selection of drinks to go with your order. The website needs some improvements, it seems to only have the ""popular"" items available, this is why I called. They can do just about anything you want within their menu. It's worth trying even if you have never tried a smash burger.",13ThirtySevenTM,Local Guide · 55 reviews · 17 photos,2 months ago,5
GrandmaStamms,"From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, we were not just embraced by the aromas of culinary mastery but also by the palpable warmth that only true passion for hospitality can exude. This establishment isn't just a place to dine; it's a destination where every meal feels like a homecoming, thanks to the owner's exceptional attitude and kind demeanor.

The food, oh the food! It's a symphony of flavors, a testament to the chef's prowess, and an ode to quality ingredients. The chicken sandwich is a masterpiece, a perfect balance of crispy, juicy chicken with a soft, yet sturdy bun, complemented by a harmonious blend of sauces and fresh greens. It's not just a sandwich; it's a journey through textures and tastes, a culinary creation that stands tall amongst the mundane.

But let's not forget the mac and cheese - a dish so often relegated to the sidelines, yet here it shines bright as a beacon of comfort food done right. It's creamy, it's cheesy, and it's infused with just the right touch of seasoning, transforming a simple dish into an unforgettable experience. Each bite is like a warm hug, a reminder of the beauty in simplicity when crafted with care and love.

The owner, with his great attitude and very kind demeanor, is the heart and soul of the restaurant. His presence adds an extra layer of warmth to the dining experience, making every guest feel valued and welcomed. It's rare to find someone who combines passion for their craft with genuine care for their customers, and this exceptional blend is what sets this restaurant apart.

In an era where dining out has become more about convenience than experience, this restaurant reminds us of the joy found in a meal prepared with passion and served with love. The chicken sandwich and mac and cheese are not just dishes; they are invitations to indulge in the art of dining, to savor each moment, and to appreciate the dedication behind every plate.

In conclusion, this restaurant is more than a place to eat; it's a haven where food meets heart, and where each visit leaves you with a longing to return. Whether it's the exquisite chicken sandwich, the comforting embrace of the mac and cheese, or the genuine hospitality that greets you at the door, one thing is clear: this is not just dining, it's an experience to be cherished.",Ayoub Sedyame,1 review,2 months ago,5

GrandmaStamms,I lost my phone on High St a couple doors down and was going into all the businesses to see if anyone turned it in. The person working the counter was great. Although they did not have my phone he offered me a piece of their peanut butter pie to help improve my day. The pie was excellent. That was the best peanut butter pie I have had in a long time. I will be back!!! Thank you very much!! Someone did find my phone and gave it to one our finest Cumberland Count Sheriffs  that happened to be walking by.

GrandmaStamms,"The Smashburger was incredibly flavorful! Great way to make a burger. I thought I was cheated on fries but that was cause they came in the bottom of their own separate To-Go bag. Infact I was given a fair, Fry Boat, amount of fries. Owners, you could save some material cost by putting the burger and the fries in the fry boat in the same bag on top of the burger, that way the customer doesn't receive two bags that each feel too lightweight; and the fries won't look so small in the bottom of their own bag. One bag, perfect value.",Tim H,Local Guide · 101 reviews · 11 photos,3 weeks ago,5
GrandmaStamms,"No condiments for the burgers! Said they ran out. Someone could’ve gone to the store before opening. Chicken is lacking flavor. Just fried with just flour or whatever was used.

GrandmaStamms,"Jake was more than accommodating. I called him and told him what I needed to feed my family and he had the entire, huge order ready and less than 10 minutes.  He also welcomed me with warm conversation and a super inviting environment. I got there at closing time and he didn't at all seem inconvenienced by my late arrival.   I got a delicious home cooked meal prepared by someone who made me feel at home. A small locally owned (by a very cool dude) business.

GrandmaStamms,"Stamms has been a staple in the Carlisle Community for as long as I can remember and I'm in my 40's. Heard about the ""Smash Burger"" and never had one so I decided to give it a try. The Sauteed Onions had way too much Seasoning they were really Salty. Maybe some other chooses in the Cheese besides processed. The Burgers Patty's were good and juicy if the Salty taste didn't over power the Sandwich. French Fries were good.

We were very hesitant at first on what we wanted to try but the menu made it easier ! Lots of organized options , combos , sides , drinks and desserts! As we are ordering our food they brought out pierogi on a hamburger it looked and smelled amazing! Now fast forward to our order , as we got our food the smell was so good my boyfriend wanted to eat the bag lol ! We were so anxious to get in and eat . The food was more than amazing ! The chicken tenders were so crispy and tasteful and the same for the fries ! Whatever seasoning you use for the fries I need it! My boyfriend got the smashburger over fries and he said it was fantastic! Amazing customer service , great atmosphere and good food !

GrandmaStamms,After a day of antique shopping we needed a place to recharge. Found Granma Stamm’s and decided to try it out. Staff were SUPER friendly and made sure our food experience was to standards. The chicken was so juicy and the crispy batter coating was nice and light. I personally don’t like a thick oil soaked batter coating so this was perfect. The fries were perfectly cooked nice and crisp with the perfect amount of salt. The Mac and cheese was super creamy. We were given an extra sandwich so I brought that home to my husband try and  the hubs also liked the chicken.,C S,3 reviews,8 months ago,4
GrandmaStamms,Stopped in because I’ve heard about their chicken for so long and recently an old high school friend and his dad bought the place and had a soft opening today. Let me tell you I was lucky enough to be their first paying customer but because I got there so early only had some tenders ready and sides. Personally I was dying to get a thigh and drumstick but was not disappointed with the tenders at all. The breading is top 5 for fried chicken I’ve had. Not too much and holds to the tender perfectly and has a great crunch when you bite into it! The chicken was juicy white meat seasoned to perfection! I also got the Mac and cheese and let me tell ya I’m glad I got the large because if not I would have turned around to get more once I finished a small lol. Creamy cheesy goodness and has its own distinct flavor unlike any other Mac and cheese I’ve had and just a touch of sweetness. I will definitely be back.,Wayne Watkins,Local Guide · 24 reviews · 3 photos,a year ago,5
GrandmaStamms,"As a treat to ourselves, my daughter and I get a fried chicken dinner with all the fixing’s once a year but had stopped during the Pandemic.We decided it was time, and wanting to try something new, we headed to Grandma Stamms. We ordered the 8 piece family meal with 2 large sides. The gentleman at the counter was very nice and informed us there would be a short wait while he fried the chicken. Soon after, we took our chicken and sides home to feast. As soon as we opened the box of chicken, we became concerned. There was hardly any breading at all, certainly not enough to give a good coating. After one bite, my daughter said disappointed, “It’s not good, mommy, KFC is better” and as much as I hate to say it, she was right. It was completely flavorless which was most disappointing of all. The stuffing ball was just that, an oversized fried ball of bland stuffing and the macaroni salad was very wet and super sweet. Not one item ordered was good. I had higher expectations and was really hoping we had found not only a better place than KFC, but one we could visit more frequently. Oh well, the search continues.",Deborah Nissley,10 reviews · 4 photos,10 months ago,2

GrandmaStamms,"Last year when we attended the Ice Festival in Carlisle we saw the Mrs. Stamm's Chicken sign and found out later from a friend that it was the best chicken in town and we simply had to try it when we attended this year.  So, that being said, the sign still read Mrs. Stamm's but the place has new owners and a new name but the taste and quality is still the same.  Hubby and I originally planned on eating lunch here before heading home Sunday afternoon but when I arrived there was quite a bit of a line and I didn't realize there was a dining area off the the side so we went for breakfast in town then called in our chicken order to take home with us.  I went with the 12 pieces of chicken and got 2 sides - the macaroni salad and the stewed tomatoes.  The couple who waited on me when I picked my order up were super nice and you can tell that they really care about putting out a quality product and they take the time to interact with their customers.  Our entire meal was exceptional, the chicken was flavorful and moist and the sides would definitely make me drive the hour and a half from my home.  The macaroni salad was sheer perfection - tender macaroni in a sweet mayo base with finely chopped onions and celery (hubby and I nearly got into a fight over the last spoonful) and the stewed tomatoes were plump and sweet.  Hubby and I are already planning a return visit in the spring and we will definitely be picking up more food from Roosters.  I did take some photos but the food smelled so good that I forgot to take them until we were halfway done but trust me, it was all absolutely delicious.",Kim Bronakoski,Local Guide · 273 reviews · 623 photos,4 years ago,5
GrandmaStamms,"All I'm going to say is...if you want some real baked macaroni and cheese and some good seasoned fried chicken, go to Speezys on Louther because the prices are outrageous with the chicken being dry and mac and cheese was gooky...what they need is someone that puts love in their food because they CLEARLY can't.",Terrell Floyd,1 review,11 months ago,1

Wendys,"Alright, me and my family went here because we did not feel like cooking on a rainy dark Sunday. Staff in the back appeared disorganized and arguing with each other about orders, food was slowly prepared and everything in our bag was cold when we got home.

I saw him punching the screen while taking orders. Throwing things, no customer service skills. I even heard him cursing at his fellow employees about how they’re open until 12:30 am.

Wendys,"I've been eating at this Wendy's for many years. Lots of changes over those years. Almost all are good.  Like with most places nowadays it's seems it's understaffed or just a lack of hustle amongst staff.
Granted it was a lot of cars in the drive thru but only one person inside ordering but it still took me about 10 minutes just to put in my order.
For me Wendys has the best burger by far but yesterday they were a bit dried out. Being a former employee of Wendy's I know they sat just a little too long but overall my meal was good. It was hot.

I know whenever I worked at a fast food place anyone who acted that way, got told about their behavior. If this continues to happen, I’ll be reporting it. It’s very unnecessary and Wendy’s isn’t gonna be keeping much customers if they don’t talk to this guy working the drive through. His attitude and temper is going to make him lose his job someday🤨. I see better for him but the way he is isn’t good. Overall, THE FOOD IS GREAT WENDYS! WAY TO GO!!!😁",Courtney Shank,6 reviews · 3 photos,a year ago,3

Wendys,"I had the most exhausting experience as a delivery driver yesterday with this restaurant. I waited in the drive through for 42 minutes. Once it was finally my turn, they said they misheard the order and to please go back through the line again so they could work on other orders. Once I made it through a second time (which was faster, about 15 minutes), they said they didn’t have the order and it must have already been picked up. I asked for it to be remade and explained the situation to three employees who all refused to remake it because “we can’t make an order twice”. Finally, an employee at the window said that turns out they heard me correctly the FIRST time through and had the order the whole time, hence it being erased from the screen of the people claiming it was picked up. Last time I’m delivering with Wendy’s…",Caroline,Local Guide · 275 reviews · 751 photos,2 years ago,1
Wendys,"Used the online car side to go app. It was a longer than usual wait and drive thru had us blocked in a few times. This resolved by cars going through the line or pulling away for what ever reason. Other cars were in the curbside pickup also. Some people were parking there and going in to get their food. I was unable to add an item through the app, so I called the store as soon as I parked and they helped me with that issue, I might add. When the food was brought to the car, it was explained that they were short staffed and apologized for the wait. Really it wasn't a to us, when ordering on a Friday night, in this work climate, you have to have some patience. As long as the order is complete and correct I am fine with some time.
It's when restaurants do not give you the food you order, the tell you they can't/won't give you the money back because it was online is when it's a customer service issue, which is not the case here.
All our food was there and was the right temperature.",c b,Local Guide · 165 reviews · 70 photos,2 years ago,4

Wendys,Most all of our food was good however I'm not sure how this happened but when he bit into a fry it tasted like a smell of sewage. Totally disgusting which ruined the entire remainder of our meal.,Vonnie Jones,22 reviews · 17 photos,a year ago,3
Wendys,"The day I went there, tie business was short staff. The workers there handled it so well and were very kind. This is very much appreciated. My food was great!",April Smith,62 reviews · 3 photos,a year ago,5
Wendys,"We order through doordash, the food is good but I had ordered iced coffee. In the app I marked creamer and all 3 ""sweetener"" options. When we got our food, there were 4 drinks and zero straws 😑 it's takeout. Straws go in the bag. Also, I ended up with a large coffee, and one tiny container of half&half and 2 pink packets. Now a lot of people are thinking I'm just complaining but after working fast food for many years, they should know to make sure there was enough.

Just be careful with orders your not able to check yourself",Lori George,Local Guide · 50 reviews · 15 photos,2 years ago,3
Wendys,The people was nice here. Service was even in a timely manner. Only thing I had a problem with is the lady at the register a device to my teenage daughter that she can take her mask off not even knowing if we were vaccinated or not. Luckily my daughter knows better vaccinations or not we're wearing masks,Carissa Handy,Local Guide · 38 reviews · 5 photos,2 years ago,3
Wendys,"Might as well just avoid eating hear. You'll either sit in the drive thru for an hour to still get incorrect food, or be treated as if it's an inconvenience for the person working drive thru to do their job. Doors always closed hours earlier than supposed to. And then they argue with you when you call in to complain. Psh unreal",K U,22 reviews · 42 photos,a year ago,1
Wendys,"In the summer, i always went through drivethrough with my bike, they always served me. That changed apparently but instead of talking to me and telling me they no longer did that, they chose to ignore me after i attempted to get someone to talk to me multiple times. I would have waited forever but i had 3 cars coming behind me and unlike Wendy's, I'm not rude and moved out of line. Ridiculous. I wouldn't be as mad if they had just told me. Unprofessional.",crescent wolfgirl,10 reviews,2 years ago,1
Wendys,"I really like the people who work the drive through here! At least one of them is all smiles and cheerful each time I go through, which brightens my day a little. The food is consistently good. I gave it 4 stars only because the parking is tight and the drive through line sometimes takes a while, but that's probably the trade off for fresh food.",Lindsay de Bien,Local Guide · 119 reviews · 99 photos,4 years ago,4

Wendys,"Never order Wendy’s at night!!! I did a DoorDash of Wendy’s food. First order they never gave him the entire order, got my refund, but I tried to reorder the same stuff that I was missing, still got it wrong and still forgot some of my food😔🙄. Nothing against the driver, he was great. First time I wasn’t mad, the second it made me mad",Brooklyn Brenizer,1 review,2 years ago,1
Wendys,Great food! Great service! One of the best Wendy's I've been to. Our host Casey was great! We missed our name being called and he brought everything to us. He had a smile the entire and was all around very pleasant! Glad we decided to come here today!,Rebecca Brown,Local Guide · 22 reviews · 1 photo,4 years ago,5
Wendys,They were open later than the internet said but did not have any baked potatoes ready for over an hour and half longer. I asked about the bacon cheese fries and kept being told how they are cooked. Not exactly understanding. I had to ask several times if I can order them or are they taking just as long as a baked potatoes? I kept getting an answer they are not cooked but I really don't know what the problem was. I ordered and they were at the next window. They were ok / good. I really wanted a baked potato though. It's all good though. I very rarely eat potatoes so my craving was only semi satisfied.,Ex Plorr,Local Guide · 23 reviews · 190 photos,2 years ago,2
Wendys,"This Wendy’s is atrocious. The man at the window who took our orders was extraordinarily rude and slow at his job. I know the hiring problem is bad right now but I’d still like to go to a restaurant without being verbally assaulted. HORRIBLE experience. Do better Wendy’s.

***UPDATE: They proceeded to forget half of our order that we were charged for.",mobile holmes,7 reviews,2 years ago,1

Wendys,Had to pick up a door dash. Called the store because the door was locked and they said I had to wait in their long and slow drive through line for a mobile order when they have mobile pick up parking spots they could have brought the order out! This Wendy’s is garbage just for that but also got many other reasons! Don’t bother waiting in their line you’ll be there 20 minutes +,Abigail Jean,2 reviews,a year ago,1
Wendys,"The food was all made correctly and I got everything I ordered, however the poor girl that took my order was swamped and seemed flustered. She was filling mobile orders, plus taking orders, plus preparing half the food that we all got. Then she had a question for I'm assuming the manager and the manager was ignorant to her, and basically yelled at her. Other than the ignorant manager and the wait time (which again, I do not blame on the girl taking the order), everything was great!",Gabby Alvirena,Local Guide · 154 reviews · 47 photos,3 years ago,4
Wendys,"So, I brought some friends with needs here for a treat, and the staff was simply wonderful. We had a little spill and they took care of everything immediately.

Wendys,"Dave's Double always hits the spot! Good fries! The meat tasted seasoned which was not my experience at the last Wendy's I tried. Usually top end fast food, Wendy's has grabbed my nerd soul by associating with Rick and Morty. It also helps that the themed soft drinks tasted good. Love Dave's cream soda too.

Wendys,"The cashier was a personable fellow but he got my order wrong because he doesn't listen well and argued with what I said. I only ever order a taco salad so I know what I ordered. It was evidenced by 2 other people coming up because their orders were wrong. I finally just ate the other salad because it was a shame to waste food. It was well made, just not what I ordered. I still like Wendy's but this location needs some help.",Conni Miller,Local Guide · 133 reviews · 160 photos,5 years ago,3
Wendys,"Worst Wendy's I've ever been to. I can't remember writing up a Google review before but this deserves one for how bad its quality is.. Line for drive-thru wraps the entire building and takes over 5 minutes to move one car length. As a DoorDash driver, they messed up multiple orders I was trying to deliver and when I come back to fix second order, the line is still just as bad. Not sure what the food quality is like, but would assume it can't be too good.",Daniel Curry,1 review · 7 photos,2 years ago,1

Wendys,"the employees on the weekend? absolute saints for not only making great food but calmly and professionally dealing with the absurdly long lines that are common. One man in particular is incredibly polite and kind even when the line wraps around the building. weeknight staff are a hit or miss, one employee in particular can be extremely snippy and rude, i believe she’s a manager/assistant manager which makes it even more odd that she is the only employee that has ever given me poor service! tonight she was working and i wish i was joking when i say i found a woman’s hair in my fries! and part of my order was wrong :( im only leaving a review because these issues were truly so out of the ordinary for this wendy’s",colorfulsnappea,7 reviews,3 years ago,3

The service was fast and employees polite and pleasant to deal with.  The hamburger did not have that old grease taste that I have gotten at some other Wendy's.  Bun was good and fresh, again unlike some other Wendy's.  I will go back next time I'm near there",Pat Smeal,Local Guide · 106 reviews · 108 photos,4 years ago,5
Wendys,Tried to order delivery through the Wendy's app twice.  Only received half my items both times.  Store claims they can't help and blames the pick up person.

Wendys,This is a decent wendy's they do suffer some with order accuracy issues but in my case they owned the mistake and rectified it. The drive thru can get to the point of causing traffic jams so may need a rework or the drive thru layout. Food is usually prepared hot and good.,Legend Cox,Local Guide · 66 reviews · 22 photos,3 years ago,4
Wendys,Was very disappointed at last visit. Stood 3rd in line for 20 minutes and had to wait another 15 minutes to get food. When u have a lunch rush you don't put a new employee at the register. And all the manager had to say to us is sorry for the wait.  Not cool at all,Audrey Woods,Local Guide · 62 reviews · 23 photos,2 years ago,2
Wendys,We ate burgers and they were very greasy. I felt sick after eating my sandwich it was that greasy. The fries were good & not overly greasy or salted & I enjoyed the Berry Cherry Iced Tea.

Wendys,"Wendy's has gotten so expensive! I could have gotten the same amount of food at Dairy Queen and paid half as much.  When you want hot chicken strips, fries and ice cream, think twice about where to go.

Wendys,"I frequent this Wendy's which is why I'm extremely perturbed. This encounter happened a few weeks back. I ordered fries and nuggets. I asked for bbq sauce. The food wasn't ready so they told me to pull up ahead and they'd bring it out to me. I reminded them 3 times about the bbq sauce and I asked again when she brought the food out. She told me yes, that they put the sauce when in fact, they did not. My nuggets and fries were dry. Very disappointing smh.

Wendys,The young lady making the sandwiches was super slow she didnt get the right toppings and SO many people returned their sandwiches because they were wrong.

Wendys,Messed up our order the night before. Ordered a baconator and instead got a single burger on a pretzel roll. Which looked very suspected to being food poison threw it out.  Everything else was old and cold. Large chilli had only literally 5 beans and little burger. Night supervisor told us to come in tomorrow and they would replace the whole order the next day. The night supervisor didn't leave all the details for the next day. Manager the next day was rude and didn't fulfill the the whole order. We felt slighted and disrespected.,Joseph Gelsinger,18 reviews,3 years ago,2
Wendys,"Just sat through a long drive thru line, because the dining room isn't opening which is fine, but messing up an order and not coming to the window when we just sat there for a couple minutes is not. I ordered and paid for a son of a baconator without cheese. Instead I got a cheeseburger (so no bacon) and cheese! Now I cannot eat the sandwich! And waiting in the line for another 30 mins isn't worth it! If I can't go in and get the right food or you won't open the window back up then you better make sure you are handing out the right food!",H B.,Local Guide · 116 reviews · 19 photos,3 years ago,1

Without my permission the girl said we were waiting for my drink that she on her own decided to swap out for a different one. I told her that's not what I ordered and she said I know but your getting this anyway. I said I don't like hi-c and she shrugged her shoulders and handed it to me.

Wendys,If you're in a wheelchair or walker do not go to this location. The renovations they made make it extremely hard to walk around throughout the place.  The staff (especially heavy set lady with white bun thing in her hair is EXTREMELY RUDE) and the younger staff seem to have no training. I have witnessed them rude and rushing elderly.  I have pointed out their rudeness to their face.  And don't dare to ask for no tomatoes...  Comment was made can't you just pick them off.  The soda dispenser always is out of flavors. And food quality  has declined.,A G,82 reviews · 3 photos,8 years ago,1

Wendys,"So my mom and I go in at about 9:00 pm. We go in, decide what we want. The woman working the counter was busy, which was fine. This woman was about 5' 3"", in her 60s, has short hair and glasses. My mom realized she forgot wallet, so she goes to get it while I order, knowing what she wants. The cashier comes over to my order and I explain that I want a 4 for 4 with double stack wanting no ketchup or mustard on it and that my mom wants a small fry and double stack with only ketchup and mustard. At first the woman taking our order didn't understand, so I reexplained. She then asks if I want a double stack with nothing on it and I repeat how I wanted the double stack. She starts getting impatient for some reason, and slightly starts talking rude. At the point I'm a bit irritated and am getting impatient too. My mom walks back in, and while this woman doesn't know what she's doing, I tell my mom I've tried ordering three times already. The cashier finally gets it right, almost, on the fourth try. She has the 4 for 4 with the correct doublestack, a small fry, but with two extra doublestacks with only ketchup and mustard. I then say we only want one extra. She then takes it off the order and it is finally correct on the 5th try. But then she walks away to the back and says to another employee, ""I need your finger."" We did not understand what she was asking of the other employee. She then tells the other employee to delete everything, and before they do, we tell them that the order was correct. But, they still delete it. The other employee walks away and the cashier then says ""let's try this again."" So I, for the 6th time, try to explain what we want. She then looks at my mom and says, ""Maybe you can explain this better."" At this point, I was absolutely pissed and tell my mom, ""I'm not taking this any more, let's go.""",Bagman,Local Guide · 18 reviews,6 years ago,1

WalnutBottomDiner,"When I travel and I see anything that ends with Diner I hope to have a great meal. The Walnut Bottom Diner did not disappoint. I arrived right after the bus arrived. The staff was great and did an excellent job of getting everyone seated an waited on. There is so much on the menu to choose from. I really wanted a breakfast meal but the ravioli sounded good too. My food arrived very quickly and very hot. The salad was fresh and the texas garlic toast was soft. My ravioli was very good and had lots of melted cheese on top of it.

We had the standard lunch fare, I had a chicken finger wrap with bacon and ranch along with fries and Cole slaw. It was okay. I couldn't detect any bacon.
My husband had the bacon cheeseburger sub with fries and slaw. It was OK according to him. Couldn't find the bacon.
My granddaughter had the Club sandwich with fries and slaw. At least I actually saw bacon in hers. Hers was good.
Her boyfriend had a Cobb salad minus a lot of ingredients.  It was basically lettuce, cheese, bacon and added sliced chicken fingers he also had fries. Also had thousand island dressing
The meal was just ok. Nothing special.",mayumi myers-zastowny,Local Guide · 127 reviews · 588 photos,a month ago,3
WalnutBottomDiner,"I loved the food at the Walnut Bottom Diner. It was good comfort food and the atmosphere was great for a bigger group (my family of 7 plus friends we were with). The meatloaf with gravy, the wraps, and burger were all fabulous. My kids especially liked the spaghetti with meatballs. The location is a little out of the way for my crew, but anytime we're in the area we enjoy stopping in for food that feels home-cooked and a friendly comfortable table. On this trip we had dinner, but the breakfast options are amazing too. I highly recommend the Farmer's Omelet.",William Merritt,Local Guide · 77 reviews · 222 photos,6 months ago,5

WalnutBottomDiner,"I was driving through the area and the people with me requested breakfast food during lunch hours. I was a little nervous when I pulled up and a few windows were boarded up. The people coming out and the ones I saw when I first walked in were of an older generation, so my hopes weren't high. Turned out to be delicious. Chicken quesadilla was rhe size my the plate. The kids meal hamburger was huge and the pancakes were also the size of the plate. I ate way more then I intended to, especially since I had to keep driving but I wanted a nap. The cakes looked great but we didn't try anything.  The food and staff get 4 stars, I'm only giving the atmosphere 4 because of the windows and general overall older feel.",Crystal B,Local Guide · 56 reviews · 94 photos,10 months ago,5
WalnutBottomDiner,"Okay Karen's- I read your reviews, and I beg to differ. We were at this restaurant on a Wednesday evening, we got here around 5 pm. Lot was pretty empty, but WOW did it fill up fast. Barely an empty spot in the lot !! Our AMAZING waiter Bush [probably did not spell that right] and another young man were the sum total of the wait staff due to shortages. As a former nurse, I recognize ""hustle with grace"" - We knew he was swamped, but he never stopped moving between his tables, and his personality NEVER faltered. We left him a 40% tip, he was that good. And as for the food. Maybe it's because we travel for our work extensively, so eating out at least one meal a day, four days a week we see A LOT of restaurants, and realize that a Paninni here is not the same as one over there, and that the coleslaw that comes with the sandwiches is meant as a condiment for ON it, not as a full size side. And might I recommend that French onion soup !!?? It is the very best I have EVER had. Nice place, large assorted menu. And decent food for the price. I fully recommend you try them out !!!",Lorie Chambers,125 reviews · 78 photos,2 months ago,5

Coleslaw serving was quite small. Therefore only 4 stars for this visit. We have been there several times before mostly for breakfast and have never been disappointed.

Put her own tip on our card at a whopping 30% gratuity!!! 😳😳😳😳😳!!! (I was not aware that you filled tip before they ran the card so she filled her own in)!!!!!

WalnutBottomDiner,"The waitress was pleasant and was very quick when serving the table. She clarified what options I wanted on the Belgian waffle I wanted without me asking, and when asked, she brought out a water pitcher for the table in a timely fashion. The only point off was that after we finished our very late night snack, around midnight mind you, it took about another 10 minutes plus to get the check so we could pay and leave. All in all, a very pleasant experience that had a  comfortable table arrangement for our group of eleven. I look forward to the next time eating there.",oRylan,Local Guide · 10 reviews,5 months ago,5

WalnutBottomDiner,"Our meal/dining experience was mediocre at best. I ordered a beef dip sandwich which consisted of overly well done and tasteless roast beef on a dense and tasteless hoagie roll. The roast beef most likely came out of a refrigerator and was nuked in a microwave to warm it up. The au jus was starchy as if it had come out of a can, and tasted like it was made from a Boullion cube and hot water. The french fries tasted like they had been tossed in an overload of baking soda before being fried, and then heavily salted after frying. My wife had a coissantwich which was similarly bland tasting. Our first clue regarding the food should have been the expansive menu. As the old saying goes, when you're a jack of all trades you're a master of none.

WalnutBottomDiner,"No frills diner with good food and even more impressive prices, especially given the large portion sizes.

My wife and I stopped by on our way put of Carlisle where we attended a weekend wedding, and our itch for a classic diner breakfast was itched. The place is large for the style, which was appreciated because it was quite busy in the late morning on. Sunday. Even so, the service was quick and accommodating and friendly, which can always be a bit hit or miss, especially for diners off the highway.

I got the breakfast special, and was impressed with the amount of food I got for under 10 bucks. 2 big pancakes, eggs, meat (I chose the more unique Scrapple option), fried potatoes, and toast I didn't manage to even get to because I was definitely full.

The pancakes were fluffy and crisp on the edges and were definitely decent, the eggs and potatoes played their part (though you'll likely need to further season them, I chose Tabasco). The scrapple took me back to childhood in rural Ohio, as it was crunchy on the outside, but very moist on the inside, with a great savory flavor that worked well alone, but especially nice with a touch of the syrup from the aforementioned pancakes. QMy wife got the Belgian waffle and bacon and was also happy with her meal, especially the low price in this modern world.

Overall, it wasn't the greatest breakfast I've ever had, but was very satisfying and well priced, and it would definitely be a place I would return to if ever in that area again. Certainly worth a stop to hit those classic cravings at a price you'll be quite happy about.",Marcus Barkley,Local Guide · 190 reviews · 243 photos,a year ago,5

Salad was fine. $18.99.
Service was very good and everything came the way we requested. It was busy at 11:45 am.

WalnutBottomDiner,"This place has really taken a turn for the worst with service. I used to go pretty often and never really had any issues even when they were busy, but my goodness that has changed dramatically over the past year.

I don't have a habit of walking out after being seated, but I did so after not being able to even get drinks for an extended period of time after being seated. Didn't even see our waitress either. What added to that decision was witnessing the host getting the table across from us their drinks because the waitress couldn't be bothered. Didn't want to waste two hours at breakfast, so we just went to McDonald's instead.

Went for an early dinner a different day. Maybe 4 other people in the diner besides me. Waitress stopped by, asked if I needed anything, I asked for another tea. She then proceeded to talk to another table for almost 10 minutes, never brought me my drink, and I had to interrupt her to ask for my check.

My daughter's Benedict was fantastic. My pancake was pretty good too. The only thing that could have been better is if the homemade potatoes were done a little longer.

WalnutBottomDiner,"Absolutely horrible!!!!!! I am so disgusted by the entire experience at this diner. Never in my life have I ever experienced such horrible customer service.

I asked if their Monte Cristo Sandwich was “deep fried”, like some are, and the waitress said, “YES”!!!! Well to my shock, it was NOT deep fried like the waitress said. I was extremely disappointed. The waitress just stood there looking at me.

I would NOT have ordered that sandwich if the waitress had indicated it was not deep fried like I asked.

I asked for the manager and a different waitress came over and looked around the room and said, “I guess I am it”…. Like really???

I expressed my disappointment and asked for a refund. She refused to comp the meal but would just throw it away and make me something else. Making something else is extremely wasteful especially when the waitress who screwed up admitted she told me incorrectly. The “supervisor” refused to give me 20%o ff my check (it was just my mother and I) but instead rather throw away the entire plate of food.

The original waitress never returned back to our table. I will never patronize this diner again with this horrible customer experience. I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!",Michelle S.,Local Guide · 36 reviews · 2 photos,8 months ago,1
WalnutBottomDiner,"Well.. first of all, we waited almost 20 minutes for our drink order.

WalnutBottomDiner,This place is your typical diner. It was generally clean and service was direct. Seems to be a stigma crossed all diners where they no longer add salt or seasoning things. I think it's to accommodate the older crowd due to them being fairly consistent breakfast and lunchers but let's get a little salt and pepper in there. Plus they forgot my bacon that went with my order.,Tex,Local Guide · 25 reviews,a year ago,3

Ordered our food and then had to go find someone (after sitting around a little) for silverware after our waitress didn't provide any. She never checked up on us, never offered refills. Honestly, the food wasn't even worth it. They seem to be keen on opening other locations, that always end up falling through. Maby just work on the one you got? Idk.

Even the spaghetti is good. But really---can't you send someone over to the Giant & get some parmesan cheese for your customers until you get a shipment in? Our waiter was very good.

There was a lot of conversation from another server who thought she didn't receive her ten dollar tip from a previous shift.  She used lots of F___ bombs in her description of her plight.  She received lots of sympathy from co workers listening.

My last two visits, one breakfast and the other for dinner.  I understand what's going on with COVID and all but what is with the silverware ? On both occasions we got our meal and sides before we got silverware.  And I had to ask for the silverware. What is the deal ? I have never seen this before, no silverware on the table when you sit down. I couldn't even stir my coffee.

However the waitress we had was horrible. Her attitude was out of this world, she literally threw the plates of food (to the point my sister said something) and creamer for the coffee onto the tables, she rarely checked to see if we needed anything (only when one of us said something, or she saw us asking another server), didn't offer refills, didn't tell us any specials, and just was down right rude.

Teamwork was evident, kitchen staff was helping carrying out trays of food behind the servers. Some were dressed for the season, in their Christmas hats, printed leggings and matching outfits.

My biggest complaint besides my server ghosting me, would be the guy that did cash me out, stood at the table and waited for me to fill out my receipt. I don't feel comfortable filling out the tip and all that with the server staring at me. No complaints about the food, I tried two different appetizers and some soup and a steak. It was all good.",Andrew Rush,28 reviews · 53 photos,2 years ago,4
WalnutBottomDiner,"My husband and I stopped in here today and were really not impressed. They were pretty unfriendly, the service was slow, and the food was not good.

The food was expensive, especially for the portion sizes and the fact that everything had a weird taste to it. I had some cheese ravioli that felt more like plastic than any kind of cheese. We also tried their “Disco Fries,” which are fries with cheese and gravy. It must have been the wrong kind of gravy or sat out to get congealed or something.

We were handed the check and the waitress walked away without saying anything. It was awkward trying to figure out if we were supposed to go up front to pay or not. She even came back, passive aggressively took our plates, and walked away without saying anything a second time.

Really wouldn’t recommend this place.",Kaite Rundgren,Local Guide · 39 reviews · 6 photos,4 years ago,2

WalnutBottomDiner,"You cannot argue with the great food and fantastic prices here. Some of the biggest and best meals in true diner style, at very reasonable prices. I definitely recommend this to anyone!

WalnutBottomDiner,The place was a bit crowded when we arrived but we were able to be seated as soon as we arrived. The waitress was very nice and patient when we were ordering our food and gave some good advice on what was good. The food came out really quickly for how crowded it was. Everything that we ordered was delicious and filling. When we got our food it was quite a lot of food and we were happy that we had more than enough to stuff ourselves and even have extra for a whole meal of leftovers. This place was definitely worth our time and money.,Peter Van Hemert,Local Guide · 69 reviews · 226 photos,6 years ago,5

WalnutBottomDiner,"The only good waitress they have is Melinda. The rest of the waitstaff are snide, off-putting and unfriendly. I understand they are majority high school and college students, but at least have some value in your work.

The booths however look like they've been to war, and are in a severe state of disrepair. Holes in the seats, patched, sticky and can feel the wood boards beneath the worn out padding.

WalnutBottomDiner,"There was only one waiter for the whole diner!! He did a fabulous job under the circumstances! Because of that, dirty dishes were piled up on tables because he was also the busboy. But that was as far as the good went. We ordered jalapeno poppers and they were overcooked to the point that all the cheese oozed out so basically we paid for breading. We both got paninis and the chicken was overcooked, tough and dry. I would have said something but the poor waiter was having a bad enough night. Definitely won't be back!

WalnutBottomDiner,"We work at a warehouse close to the diner, came here to eat after work. I ordered the sampler platter, and the loaded potatoes were very over cooked, when the male waiter asked how everything was we told him and he said nothing and just rudely walked away. The mozzarella sticks were barely warm, and the onion rings were also over cooked. I ate what wasn't overdone and was almost finished eating when the waiter brought 2 fresh potatoes done as the others should have been, my arm was next to my plate and he literally pushed it out of the way with the potato plate! At that point I was so disgusted with his behavior, I didn't even want the new potatoes. When I went to pay, he slapped my card down on the counter and didn't even hand it to me. I was never rude to him at all, he acted extremely unprofessional, quite possibly the rudest waiter I have ever had, we will never come back here to eat again.",Melinda,Local Guide · 184 reviews · 41 photos,a year ago,1

WalnutBottomDiner,Eh... not sure what the hype is about.  It was okay.  As another reviewer mentioned the home fries were totally bland.  Dousing them in ketchup helped a tad.

When I went to the restaurant to pick it up, wait staff were not wearing face coverings over their noses, guests were not required to wear masks and many were not wearing them to pay or while waiting in the checkout area. In addition the restaurant was busy with dine in customers despite the governor's mandate. Staff were touching their faces, not wearing gloves, and there wasn't a coherent sense of cleanliness or precaution. Eat here at your own risk.

WalnutBottomDiner,"One of my favorite diners. I always stop here when I'm in Carlisle.

I first posted a review a year ago and had a great experience. I'm editing my review to reflect my experience at the diner today.

Our food was great and our waitress was fantastic, but we had a terrible experience.  We asked for a booth and waited. Then a group who came in after us was taken to be seated at a booth and then we were taken to a table. We saw an empty booth and asked if we could sit there and the waitress agreed and mentioned it to the man seating us and he proceeded to yell at the waitress and was really rude to her. He was so rude that the people in a booth sitting nearby apologized to the waitress and said they were finished anyway and offered us their booth and left. We sat down there but then the waitress said she's probably going to get in more trouble since we sat there even though it was a different booth and the couple there had left.

The first booth that we weren't allowed to sit in stayed empty the entire time we were there. And we felt really bad for the waitress having to deal with such a ridiculous outburst that made everyone in the dining room really uncomfortable. There was no reason for him to be so horrible to the waitress.

I used to like coming here when I'm in town, but if something like this happens again, I might find a different diner. I wonder if anyone else has had an experience like this?",Amanda Mcneil,Local Guide · 125 reviews · 447 photos,2 years ago,3
WalnutBottomDiner,"Was there late on a Sunday night. Place was clean and the food was better than expected, the only complaint I have is the staff seemed unwilling or unsure if they could make a requested modification to an omelette. Then they told us the people who could make that decision or give them direction on how, ""decided not to show up tonight."" All front of house staff there seemed disconnected and just going through the motions to get by. This could have been a good 5 star review with a little enthusiasm and better customer service from the staff.",Keith Flynn,Local Guide · 170 reviews · 273 photos,5 years ago,4

I would definitely recommend this place to everyone and I will be returning for the wonderful staff.",Tara Unger,7 reviews,6 years ago,5
WalnutBottomDiner,"Good, hometown breakfast.  The wait was minimal and the food was hot.  But the best part of the meal was the service.

I ran out to get it and  got back to work opened it up and no gravy, no butter, the stuffing was mushy bread absolutely no flavor. The side of cranberry sauce was laughable,  not even a slice out of canned cranberry sauce. Turkey was dry. Highly highly disappointed, will NOT be eating from there again. Will be taking this food back when I'm done work because I could not make another trip out to pick up gravy. I'm not paying $15 for this.",Kellie Clyde,2 reviews,2 years ago,1
WalnutBottomDiner,"Food was satisfactory; nothing stellar. Main issue was the 1hr 30min wait after being seated. When asking the waiter how much longer it would be, he got defensive to the point of having an attitude then accused our table of being rude when we simply asked for the checks.

His reasoning was that there was only one cook, yet there were at least two tables seated after us; a party of 7 and a party of 4. Meaning the cook was ordered to cook at least 11 dishes before our food was delivered. Maybe the waiter was having a bad day, but I highly doubt it given his response.",Charlie Neilson,1 review,2 years ago,2
WalnutBottomDiner,"Food is good! However, the AC in the restaurant is currently broken and it’s so freaking hot in there.

I believe every breakfast place should offer real maple syrup. It's natural,tastes amazing and has a way better glycemic effect. Even if you charge extra for it people would buy it but another option is build the extra cost of it in the breakfast. I'll definitely be back while traveling through.",Jimmy Story,Local Guide · 296 reviews · 352 photos,2 years ago,4

The person who seated us (young teen) wore his mask only over his mouth and that didn’t even stay up. We were seated in a booth next to the kitchen and were happy to see no one else in our area. Mid meal several others were seated. Table are not staggered and they were all seated less than 6 feet apart. The waitress smelled horribly of cigarettes but was very nice and attentive.

Me and my husband both work in the restaurant industry and would never even think about serving the food we witnessed today. My kids food wasn’t even edible and it was a grilled cheese. They don’t care about the quality of food they are serving just trying to get your money. They even charged me for toppings the meal was advertised to come with and then I asked for no toppings and my food came out with it on and they still charged me. My poor server was so kind and even said she wouldn’t have eaten it as well. Just disgusting and absolutely repulsive food all we could eat was French fries.

WalnutBottomDiner,😬 sweet tea was awful. I didn't feel comfortable trying anything but a salad. It was ok and non traditional. Honestly it was a big bowl of salad that your teenager would make.

WalnutBottomDiner,"The waitress told us to follow her and went to sit us at a table, then said “table or booth” I said “booth if it’s not a problem” and she rolled her eyes and put the menus down. She asked what we wanted to drink, brought the drinks then disappeared for 15/20 minutes. She came over and asked if we wanted more coffee and took our order and came once more to bring our food. She said loudly across the restaurant “anything else I can do for you” I said “not right now thank you” so she brought us Togo boxes and said “you can meet me at the front.”

I dont know if maybe she had a long shift but she wasn’t friendly at all. I wasn’t going to tip her because it was horrible but they have to add the tip to cards themselves and I didn’t want to be rude.

WalnutBottomDiner,"Before I give a review of the food which would have received 4 Stars, I feel I need to make people aware of their unscrupulous business practices, which would receive 0 Stars.

When we first sat down and the waitress came over to take our order, she explained that even though there was prices listed on the menu the manager would charge a higher price sometimes. I'm not exactly sure how he convinced someone to pay more than the menu price.
There was a huge board as you walked in of the Specials for dinner along with the prices. My hubby and I chose the Chicken Fried Steak dinner with was listed for $10.95 (the price is important here). Dinner was very good, the waitress was very attentive.

So the waitress brings the bill and leaves. I pickup the bill and notice that the price of the dinner on the check is for $11.99 (not the price special of $10.95). So we figure she made a mistake and charged the normal price.
Called the waitress over and showed her the incorrect price, she says she'll be back. When she comes back, she says nope the price is right. I said no it's not. (There were so many specials we had taken a picture of the board so we could decide what we wanted.) I said we have a picture right here with the specials and prices, that it's $10.95.
Then the waitress says the hostess made a mistake when she wrote it and the manager says it's $11.99. I told the waitress to go tell the manager that I'm not paying more than the $10.95 listed. The manager wouldn't come over to the table, but expected the waitress to do his job for him. She came back and said the manager laid all the blame on the hostess again and still wanted $11.99.
I told her once again I'm not paying anymore than the $10.95 and if the manager didn't like it, to come talk to me. He wouldn't come over, so she fixed it by giving us a 10% discount. Which was less than the special dinner price.

Apparently the manager changing the prices to a higher price is a common practice at this diner. It's not just dinner that the prices are higher but breakfast and lunch as well. I also heard from the staff at the diner that they charge higher prices to the various clubs such as the car clubs which stop there to eat.
So if you don't want to get ripped off by being charged more, check your bill out.
It's unfortunate that the manager is so unscrupulous because their food was very good.
I don't think the wait staff or the hostess should have to deal with being accused of doing their job incorrectly, when the manager can't be bothered checking the specials board before it's placed out for their customers to see. Maybe they should look into getting a new manager and get rid of than one that can't do his job.",Ginny Lyon,Local Guide · 254 reviews,4 years ago,1

WalnutBottomDiner,"Clean establishment. Friendly and professional staff. My dining partners each chose senior meals. They received large servings for senior menu. Baked haddock looked good and she said was tasty. The other meal was turkey with filling and gravy. It was your typical luncheon meat turkey, canned gravy and instant potatoes. I had bacon and eggs. I was happy that my bacon was not deep fried like so many places are doing. I usually stick with breakfast at diners. There are many diners in the Carlisle Pa area. This one suits me.

Their ""poutine"" which is called disco fried were appaling and consisted of pretty decent fries ruined with a joke called gravy and white American cheese.

My wife ordered the cheese ravioli was chewy and tasteless and definitely not fresh and my spaghetti with meatballs had a weird sour taste to them.

Today I ordered peirogies.  The menu says served with sour cream. There was no sour cream. not a major crisis but not right.

His prime rib was so tough he couldn't even hardly cut it. My dinner was horrible. The noodles were cold and I could barely chew my beef tips. The soup of the day was either seafood bisque or chicken and rice. I got the chicken and Rice. When she brought it out it was chicken noodle. It was surprisingly good.

WalnutBottomDiner,"BY FAR my favorite place to eat in Carlisle. Hands down. I have not had one single thing to eat here that I haven't loved. Everything has been quick, consistent, and delicious. This is no ordinary 24-hour diner. This gives the classic feel with the diner atmosphere, but still delivers on a high level of consistency. The wait staff is some of the friendliest that I have ever seen and they go above and beyond to ensure high satisfaction. No wonder they are one of the highest rated places to eat in Carlisle. Their Monte Cristos, Breakfast Croussiantwiches, omelets, French Dip paninis, and fries (just to name a few) have blown me away with how good they are. All of these dishes are not only extremely satisfying, but they're quick to come out. Even on a busy Sunday morning, we still get our breakfast in maybe 10-15 minutes. I LOVE WALNUT BOTTOM DINER!!

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"Had not been to a CB in years due to not being near one.  Decided to make the one hour drive since we used to love CB. Disappointed is an understatement.  Our waitress was not nice,  didn't even bother to refill drinks. The food was extremely bland and looked nowhere near as good as the photos in the menu. Extremely small portion sizes. Roast beef was tough and loaded with grisle,  fish was very small and also not good.  Even the coke was gross, tasted like water with a little coke in it. Cannot recommend and won't be back. For the price absolutely feel ripped off!",Tiffany Serijna,Local Guide · 130 reviews · 26 photos,a month ago,1
CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"Stopped by on a Saturday night for dinner. I had fried chicken, mac and cheese, and fried okra.
Chicken breasts were okay. Nothing special, I've had better not I have certainly had worse. The mac and cheese was lukewarm temperature and kind of runny but then again not the worst thing I have ever had.. Fried okra was good and I always love the biscuits and corn muffins that I get at Cracker Barrel.

Now for the rest of the story....My wife had the chicken pot pie and she absolutely loved it. Nice crust. Favorable chicken, gravy, and vegetables inside and served at a warm temperature.

Wait time was about normal. Serve was good. Atmosphere at Cracker was always nice. Prices are reasonable.

Will most likely return there sometime in the future.",Richard Ireland,Local Guide · 74 reviews · 278 photos,2 months ago,3
CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"We ordere a pick up and were told it would be done at 6:02. After being told 10 more minutes by staff inside 3 times, and waiting in the parking lot for 40 minutes my husband brought our food home for the family, $113 worth. When we started unpacking we realized we were missing most of our sides and two entire meals. The food we did have was cold, burnt to a crisp and hard. I called in to see if they forgot a bag and if we could get a replacement bun at least for my child’sd burger since it was inedible. Honestly, an apology even for waiting that long for absolutely horrible food and only part of our order would have helped even. I was on hold 4 different times while the poor retail girl begged the manager to come to the phone. Not once would Jared, the manager on duty last night, speak to me. The girl couldn’t offer any refund or excuse and couldn’t do anything for me without his approval. There was no other food waiting and I wasted a half hour with no resolution. I’ve never been so disappointed in a restaurant’s customer service honestly. It ruined my kids birthday dinner with our family, she literally talked all day at school about how she couldn’t wait for Cracker Barrel dinner. By 7:30pm we were out over $100 dollars and my kid ate sliced strawberries and biscuits for dinner. They even sent along the receipt showing the items we were missing not checked off.",Taylor Stape,3 reviews · 4 photos,4 months ago,1
CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"The service was good.   I just wished the waitress would have seen my plate,  had mostly all yoke.    Where's my eggs?    I would have appreciated the extra mile and had my eggs redone.    I didn't say anything.    Eggs are nature's food.  And on a cold day,   I don't know why the ceiling fans were on, it made a chill breeze on our necks and also,   it made the food get cold fast.",Joi Dorr,Local Guide · 118 reviews · 198 photos,5 months ago,3
CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,Unfortunately we didn’t have the best experience we were at our table for 15 minutes before the waiter showed up. After she didn’t come back with drinks or biscuits until another 15 minutes. And then we waited another 35 minutes for food. My food was wrong since I order two pieces of fish I got one and my daughter and my Mac and cheese was a bit burnt not how it’s usually served. Also one of our sides didn’t come with our food. I been out of country for 3 years and I thought it was better then this and this judgment wasn’t made with 1 visit and Covid-19 can’t be used as an excuse anymore. Will not be coming back and don’t recommend.,2023 R,Local Guide · 80 reviews · 81 photos,7 months ago,1

But the food was not that good. Very salty and the potatoes were cold.

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"My husband and I ate here on March 22,2024 for dinner. I think we were given the worst server in the world. Was around 430 not to busy at all. Her name was Heather she was the most rude server and very short with us from the moment we sat down. We were her only customers at the time. She took our order we asked for biscuits and cornbread then she never came back till our order was ready. Got our biscuits and cornbread with our order not before. I watched her with her other customers as they were getting settled and she was very polite and came and checked on them throughout their meal. When we went to leave we saw her hanging out by the restroom with a guy so I guess this is why she did not have time for us. So her boss needs to pull her aside and tell her. Heather all of our customers are important not just the ones you have time for. We will not be back to your restaurant as it was not pleasant. And we do understand that it is hard to get good people but you shouldn’t have to have rude ones.",Sandra Ganoe,7 reviews,3 weeks ago,1
CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,We stopped during our trip to get a nice sit down breakfast.  I really wanted a nice breakfast.  We got the old timers breakfast.  The thick bacon was rubber.  The biscuits weren't bad but the gravy had no flavor.  The baked apple slices weren't cooked long enough and again no flavor.  I was disappointed.   I really wanted to like this place.  The store part was interesting.,Tara Kelly,Local Guide · 83 reviews · 25 photos,2 months ago,3
CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"Food was okay, not delicious but okay and  I strongly feel we got ripped off today.

Had 2 small mashed potatoes, a small green salad and a tiny  bowl of fruit ( to be precise: 9 blueberries, 3 strawberries and 4 small pieces of pineapple.

Even though it said differently on the card and the small meals were listed on the card as side dishes, 1,99 each and also I asked the waitress BEFORE ordering.

English is only my second language and I am a visitor, which I told the young lady.
I thought she was friendly, because she explained to me the dishes.

After eating and receiving the bill, no one could explain to me  ( we asked 3 different persons there ),why I had to pay 9,99 $ more than it said on the card.
That means, for 4 small side dishes 1 paid 20$, on the card it it said 1,99 $ each.

I of course I paid it , because I didn't want to ruin the time for me and my daughter who I hadn't seen for many years ( I'm visiting from Europe).

I have no evidence, but I strongly feel, I got ripped off by the young lady.

So be vigilant, especially if you are not local, and ask before you eat, what the price is.

How they treat you there is not okay.",Shield,Local Guide · 23 reviews · 2 photos,2 months ago,2
CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,NEVER AGAIN.  Waited 1 hr for dinner AT THE TABLE for 2 people and we could not wait any longer. The waitress apologized and said they were working on a large catering order. The entire restaurant was at a stand still. Nobody was getting food and everyone was upset and complaining. If they couldn't serve anyone why seat us only to wait over an hour or more? What a joke.  They should send us a check for our time wasted.,TheHouse,31 reviews,a month ago,1
CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,Cracker Barrell is my favorite and has been for many years.

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,The food here is good. I love that they serve breakfast all day. Except for when I ordered this morning. The bacon was not cooked properly.

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"Ordered food for take out, arrived after the time indicated and 10 minutes later was told they were out of 1 of the items.  My husband did not want a replacement so told them not to worry about the item they were out of.  After waiting another 20 minutes the to go person said she would get the manager.    He did not know what was going on and I said I just want my food only for him to return and say the order was canceled!!  Unbelievable!   I left as I was not going to wait any longer and got food elsewhere and noticed the next day my order was charged.   When I called, the manager indicated he requested a credit, the charge should have never gone through in the first place!

The only real downside was the overwhelming smoke smell from the fireplace.  So much so that when I went to put on my shirt (that I had worn there) a few days later, it still smelled like smoke.

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"We go to CB rather frequently. Since they publish calories directly on the menu, it helps us with our calorie-counting choices. Most of the time, service is great, but it does waiver at times. We left a week or two ago bc we had not even been acknowledged after over 15 minutes of sitting at our table. The food is consistent. It’s certainly not gourmet, but it serves its purpose.",Matt Willey,26 reviews · 5 photos,3 months ago,4
CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"After 7 pm the food is not that great. Grits didn't taste right, corn muffins half the normal size. We're very brown and didn't taste good.

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"Ordered online for pick up, when I arrive my food has a note that my entree will be an additional 30 minute wait. Staff at the counter did not acknowledge that I had been standing there. The manager came to talk to me after I had been waiting for 45 minutes, and I had to ask for them to come out. Waited over an hour watching customers be seated then watching them pay after eating their meals. Cannot rate food because I am still waiting.

Update: from 1 star to 5 stars. Manager, Jared, compensated all meals and was very pleasant during interactions. I returned 2 days later because I had not received my refund, he compensated 2 meals that evening as well.",Jenna Stoner,6 reviews · 2 photos,4 months ago,5
CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,The food was the worst I ever had in cracker barrel   I did not complain because couldn't find the waiter and had to chase him for check and when I got the check he was eating  cause he was chewing when handed it to me spoke with food in his mouth.  Totally unprofessional and disgusting.. I usually would have complained but  this was first day of vacation and was trying not to get aggravated.  I ended up paying and eating at mcd's.  So much better then what I was served under the ruse of being edible. I will never recommend this location.,Kenneth Buckley,31 reviews · 6 photos,a month ago,1

She finally sent the manager over and he asked how everything was and we told him it was cold he apologized and walked away.  The whole experience was horrible.

Eggs were supposed to be over easy ( dippy) they were extremely hard, the sausage patties were the size of a silver dollar and the consistency of a hockey puck, and last but not least, the sausage gravy had apsolutely no flavor!!

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"Was busy when we arrived, not sure if they were short staffed for the day or are just short staffed. There were many tables pushes together for large parties in the center dining area. The hostess triple sat the section we were seated in, so we were given the wicker basket of napkins and silverware but no drink orders were taken, of course we were the last table sat and the server was getting a little run off her feet. Our questions about menu items were answered matter of fact with no personal preference.
Food was good even if it sat in window long enough to make the plates pretty hot to the touch. The manager on duty help bring food the food to our table and was friendly. Small tables emptied and filled quickly. We waited for drink refills. Sad, because their sweet tea and peach tea are hard to beat.
I tried the maple bacon glazed chicken tenders. It was so delicious, I asked to sub the dill pickle ranch. Wow, the ranch really compliments the sweetness of the glaze and the peppery crunch of the battered chicken. A new favorite, I will get again.",c b,Local Guide · 165 reviews · 70 photos,2 years ago,3
CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"I have historically loved Cracker Barrel and enjoy stopping at them on road trips.  This location was a total letdown.   There had maybe 6 sat tables at 7:30/8:00.  We did not get silverware, plates, or bread.  The server was slow, and they were not even busy.  At one point I looked up and there was not a single server in the floor.  Manager was nowhere to be found.  I must assume they were all in the back hanging out, as they were amply staffed.  Save one hard working busboy who brought me some water, it was the most slovenly example of waitstaff I can recall.

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"Im a big Cracker Barrel fan. Its cheap, food is good, and service is decent. I go in with low expectations and high tolerance for the challenges a chain restaurant faces.

Unfortunately this place is impressive in its poor quality. Lunches are reheated leftovers from the night before with no attempt to disguise it. Now ill eat leftovers with the best of them, but this is ‘cooked 12 hours ago, left out for a while, refrigerated, then microwaved right before lunch’ leftovers.

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"Gave cracker barrel another chance after they forgot to take our order last time, and disappointed once again.  We ordered drinks and waited 15 minutes to order food... waited 30 more minutes when the waitress stopped by to say the food would be out shortly.  Waited another 17 minutes before she brought out PART of our order forgetting about the sausage gravy and the biscuits. We had to flag her down to ask for those items. The food was OK but not worth the wait. All the while people were seated after us and eating before we were even served. We didn't even get an apology or discount on anything for her mistake.  I am almost certain she forgot to put our order in to be made and when realized it,  stopped over to say our food was still coming out. Never again",C.

Took 30 minutes to be told they had no chicken tenders which I ordered
Another 10 minutes till my party received their food…which was cold! Yes cold!!!! . I sat with no food for another 10 minutes without the waitress even saying mine would be out
shortly!
My husband had to ask for tartar sauce twice,  bacon was ordered crispy, it was not!
Fried pickles came …. No sauce!
Had to ask for ketchup, and small plates ; which we were told they didn’t have many! The whole bin was dropped and broke most of them!  I was going to offer to go to Walmart and get them some…. The whole meal and waitress was absolutely pathetic!!!!!!!!!! Bob

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"Above & Beyond in EVERY way!  From cordial greeting, seating me by the fire, friendly & attentive young lady waitress that went above & beyond to come out and find me in the gift shop to let me know my dinner was served so it didn’t get cold.  Not many kids today would bother to do that.  Her shift lead was always looking out to make sure things were being done.  And she was working right along with them!  When I motioned her to.come over to let her know how impressed I was with how well my waitress took care of me, she could have just accepted the glory, but being the true team player tvat she is, she not only went back to the kitchen so the entire staff could give a shout out to my waitress, she elevated it to her manager, who came out and sat down with me with a very big smile!  It was so nice to truly extend compliments, especially at this time of year, and especially when they usually are only called out for problems.  He truly cared about his restaurant and his employees and it showed in every level from the first impression to checking out.  I felt like a Secret Santa when I handed my waitress my tip which was significantly more even than the cost of my $18 chicken dinner and getting to know that the manager and I share similar interests in fine art, was like making a new friend!

I don’t want to turn this negative but within just the two prior weeks, I visited the Mechanicsburg location and had the complete opposite experience where after waiting 55 minutes for my dinner, saying something about the wait, to the kid who was literally brushing the crumbs from the next table onto me, and watch him sashay away with half a shrug and not in tbe direction of the kitchen, I opted to get up and pay for my drink and leave.  No manager ever came to check on me even by the time I got to the register.

So if you can, avoid Mechanicburg at all costs & go to Carlisle.  Its literally like night and day, with the Carlisle Cracker Barrel being superior to many restaurants, even other chsins & mom& pop’s, in every way!

And if you go out on a holiday to dine, you better leave a 25% tip minimum or just stay at home and put a tv dinner in the microwave.  To go out and dine and not tip is THEFT, unless you experience a problem, & then elevate it so they can fix it!  Thank you!

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"I am normally not one to complain but last night my husband and I came to eat dinner.  We normally come for breakfast.  Our service and meal was absolutely horrid.  My husband ordered the country boy breakfast and I ordered the southern chicken meal.  We also ordered an appetizer.  Our waiter came to use and stated that the sides I ordered weren't available. I chose another side.  My husband began to eat his grits and they were cold and not fully cooked.  The waiter then came back out and stated the other side I ordered wasn't available.  About this time the manager came out to speak to the table next to us about their complaints.  He stated they were short staffed and their delivery truck didn't show for the day. He walked away from the table rolling his eyes.  Meanwhile, our waiter came back and we had also asked for the usual biscuits that come with our meals and he finally brought them out after multiple requests and they were burnt.

While we waited for our meals we watched multiple employees walking around sitting at tables with other customers.

Next we got coffee and asked for sugar as my wife waited she had to remind the waitress.  When she finally got the sugar the coffee was cold yet did she offer a hot cup no.

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"I had the French toast but it was made with sourdough bread which was very heavy. I had the apple topping which I enjoyed except the apples aren't peeled so it was texturally unappealing. I ended up having to remove the apple skin from my mouth. I gave it four stars because it is unusual for Cracker Barrel meal not to be good and I didn't see that it was made with sourdough bread; the menu is cluttered and font and color of the menu make it difficult to read. French toast should be fluffy and light; butter, syrup, cinnamon, and powdered sugar. I don't recommend this breakfast plate.",Elvera Sobczak,Local Guide · 134 reviews · 238 photos,4 years ago,4

The servers were very nice. Confused on our orders but fixed it and gave some extras which is a big save. Food was good and very reasonably priced. Highly recommend the cornbread catfish meal. There were 11 different meals ordered and only the ham plate was sub par. Of course that was the head coaches plate. So from a basketball statistic C-B shot 91% from the Freethrow line. Pretty good.

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"Ordered takeout through their website and was given a time for pickup.  Arrived at the store about 5 minutes after that time, followed the link they sent me by text message and told them that I was there, which parking stall I was in, confirmed my make/model/color of car, and waited.  About fifteen minutes later, someone pulled into the stall next to me and got their order within a couple of minutes of showing up.  The lady who brought it out for them gave me a weird look, asked my name, then said she'd be right back with my order.  About ten minutes after that, someone ELSE showed up and got their order within a couple of minutes.  Having figured out that she was not, in fact, coming back, I went into the store to ask what was going on, and was told that they were just bagging my order now (mind you, this is now over 30 minutes after I was told it'd be ready) and I went back out to my car to wait.  It took at least another 10 minutes after that before someone came out with my order, asked me how my day was going, and when I told them what was going on received a very curt ""Sorry for the wait"" before he handed me my order.  One of the jugs of tea he gave me did not have the lid properly secured, so when I put it in the car and it tipped over the lid came off and flooded my passenger seat with peach tea.  It took him another five minutes to come out with a replacement for that and I received no other acknowledgement of the issues other than ""Have a nice day.""  What should have been a five minute interaction turned into an almost hour-long fiasco that left me angry and frustrated.

When I got home, the food was extremely dry, having apparently sat under a heating lamp for the entire time that I was waiting.  The sirloin tips were entirely inedible (my dog and cats liked them well enough, I guess), and everything else just tasted dried out and slightly scorched.

I have no idea what happened, my only guess is that for some reason the link given in their text message failed to report that I was there even though it confirmed my arrival and told me to ""sit tight, your food will be out shortly"".  If you dare to risk ordering takeout from here, don't rely on the link, call the store and tell them you're there.",Ken Martyn,8 reviews,9 months ago,1

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"This was the worst experience we have had a Cracker Barrel ever. It was my birthday and the experience started bad with the rude hostess putting us in a front corner table facing the wall even though the restaurant was mostly empty.  We asked if we can be moved to the large open section and basically, she refused due to no staff.  Yet three minutes later the section began till fill as she likely was just too lazy to move us.
We complained and the manager didn't show up until the end of our meal when it was too late to move us.  He had a I don't really care attitude.  Our server was very nice, but the food wasn't up to normal Cracker Barrel standards.  Several items, such as, Jam and greens , were unavailable as well.

Waitress was clueless and apparently new to the job.   Had to ask for the bread basket a few times before it was brought over and had to ask for ketchup for a cheeseburger.   Waitress brought only a carafe of oil, thinking it was dressing. Baked potato loaded with sour cream that I didn't request. In all fairness, food was Ok, but service pitiful.

This was a joke ,I know prime rib has fat, but mine looked like it had bin through a broken meat grinder, and the fat was unreal. Thankfully my guest brought covered dishes ,and desserts. For the two other tables. Even the pies came with major broken shells. Never again. I'll post pics in comments from the pics as advertised to what I got. Yes I know pics will look better then what you get. But to brutally attack and serve that as prime rib was wrong! Yes it was pre-sliced when I received it. Not advertised that way.

Especially since we were offered them and paid for them.",K Stone,Local Guide · 220 reviews · 1 photo,a year ago,1
CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"I order food to go, I was told about 15 minutes and I waited for them to bring me my take away.  They never did so I checked at the take out shelf , it was there (for how long I don't know) then I took it back to my hotel room, went to start eating but no silverware or napkins! What were you expecting me to eat with my fingers? My food was cold by the time I was able to finally eat. AND to think I left a tip!! Maybe the person who took my order was new but still should have handed my food to me not on take out shelf since I was right there.
I would not recommend this place if you plan to take out. Cannot speak about dining in.",Joyce Wilson,Local Guide · 48 reviews,a year ago,3
CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,Absolutely horrible.. not busy but always run out of food. They have a wait time alot yet there are open tables(waitresses just can't handle more then 2 at a time)Just horrible management period. Only 1 or 2 servers actually know there job.

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"Great food and service but NOT a RV FRIENDLY location. We do a lot of cross country camping with a 40' 5th wheel. Most Cracker Barrel locations offer convenient parking for all size RVs. This one directs guests to a small parking lot behind a neighboring hotel. The space was VERY tight with minimal spaces and can only accommodate smaller RVs and trailers. Luckily it wasn't a busy time so we parked in the main parking lot along an island and only covered 2 parking spots. Like all Cracker Barrels, our server was super sweet and the food was yummy. The food was exceptionally slow but this location was actively recruiting new help so they must be short staffed. Despite the parking dilemma for RVs, this Cracker Barrel was still very good.",Stephanie Pickup,Local Guide · 66 reviews · 12 photos,a year ago,4
CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,Honestly I typically go for finer dining but I can't help to be drawn back to a childhood favorite. This Cracker Barrel in particular has great food and wonderful staff. Honestly the young man who waited our table was one of the best experiences I've had in awhile. We ate breakfast for dinner and got a solid sit down meal with great service all for the same price or less you'd pay for fast food these days. I always enjoy checking out the knick knacks in the shop and have really no complaints! Easy access from 81 also makes this a great place for travelers to stop and rest for a minute. The bathrooms were also clean and stocked. No worries on making this place your next stop on your trip!,C C,Local Guide · 77 reviews · 34 photos,2 years ago,5

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"The good was very hood. Like home cooked and I even enjoyed the little shop! I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the service. I completely understand that it was packed to the limit and a wait to get in. Which I was perfectly fine with because I love  browsing in the shop. When we were seated we felt like we were more like cattle being pushed through rather than paying customers. When the waitress took our order she was not hospitable at all. My husband ordered a sampler platter which was chicken, meatloaf and some other meat and I had fried shrimp. The food was very good. When we were 3/4 done with our meal ghe waitress brought the check, put it on the table THEN asked if we wanted anything else. We were not difficult by any means. We ordered quickly and knew exactly what we wanted. We weren't loud and it was just the two of us.

She has been there a long time and my opinion she is one of the best servers I have met. The manager Steve came out. He is really nice and helpful too. I love the environment and food.

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"The food was pretty good, and up to Cracker Barrel standards for the most part. However,  the mashed potatoes were slightly warmer than room temperature,  and the pinto beans didn't look as good as they normally do.

However,  the high point was our server Garrett (sic?), who was absolutely hilarious and entertaining. Also, the trainee had good customer service as well. In addition,  they allowed me to modify my order without any problems.

The only disappointment is that they didn't offer us biscuits or cornbread. With that being said, I wasn't upset because it was the trainees first day, and the Cracker Barrel biscuits and corn bread really aren't all that great to begin with, so I didn't even ask for them.",John Christopherson,Local Guide · 265 reviews · 188 photos,2 years ago,4

I wanted catfish since they got rid of the pan fried haddock, but to my surprise, they don't sell the catfish either. I ended up having grilled chicken fingers which wasn't too bad. The biscuits were so hard I could only eat a part of the top. My husband had chicken fried steak. His pinto beans were so dry that he couldn't eat them. His steak was more like a huge chicken breast.

Then when I went to pay (drinks weren’t taken off as a courtesy but that’s OK…) The lady asked me how everything was and I told her “eh it was just ok..” and not another word was said.

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,Worst service EVER! That is if you even get a server to greet you at your table within a 20-minute time I worked in the service industry as a waitress for many many years and I understand the plate of the server however you are supposed to greet your server within 2 minutes at least with a cocktail napkin and let them know that you know that we're here this was the second time that my boyfriend and I try to eat at your establishment and the first time was less than satisfactory to the server was less than helpful and the food was very rough and the reasoning behind the first visits negligence was they were short-staffed so I will not be going back to this established,Erin Donst,7 reviews,2 years ago,1

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"When I have eaten here, they food is decent and service is okay. But as someone who works for door dash… I have to say this is one of the worst restaurants to pick up food from. They are never on time, frequently the front of the house doesn’t even speak to you when you come in to get the food and you have to ask several people to actually get someone to check on the order. It’s crazy, because the people who order from the mobile delivery service are customers too, they paid for Cracker Barrel s food just as if they came to eat there… but they are not given the same consideration by the restaurant as those customers that choose to dine in.
I would not advise people to place mobile delivery orders from this establishment, I frequently have to wait  20 min or more when I come to pick it up, so your order will be late.",Carlisle Cockatoo,5 reviews,2 years ago,2

While we were playing their stupid triangle game for what felt like forever. The waitress did not check up on us once as we waited for our food.

Server hadn't stopped by since bringing our food, no drink refills, had to go ask manager for the bill after waiting 15 minutes.  Many tables were waiting on initial service, drinks, two tables near us hadn't been seen since seating after 15 minutes.

Appears like many establishments to be short staffed, help wanted signs out front.  All management staff was on the floor actively cleaning tables, taking orders, delivering food.

I waited tables, it's a hustle.  But not checking on customers, no refills (and it's water, easiest thing to bring imho), not getting the bill in a timely fashion so they can leave, really isn't cool.  Especially when it's not slammed.",Blair Thomas,16 reviews,2 years ago,3

When asked if everything was ok, I explained my disappoinment with the biscuits without mention of the gravy.

The Waitress brought me a fresh order with the biscuits hot and soft.  Turned out the gravy too was different and not colagulated. Sadly the second serving was not overly enjoyed because of what I forced down of the first serving.

I am convinced the kitchen grabbed  old food that had been stting out for some time

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,The staff really do not care about social distancing. We were going to go for dinner and left. The staff do not bother wearing masks. We walked by a cracker barrel sign outside mandating masks for staff and patrons and it was cast aside. Law or not - the staff should be masked. We were very uncomfortable.

There was five of us in our party.
There was no wait to be seated. They took our order and brought our drinks. We had our food in less than fifteen minutes.
I ordered a serloin steak. It was cooked to perfection. The meat was thick, tender and juicy!
Everyone in my party was very pleased with the service and the food.

waitress was wonderful and very attentive. The atmosphere is always welcoming and pleasant.
I was disappointed in my pork chop entree. They were so thin I would never have recognized them as pork chops......they were as thin as corregated cardboard, but they did not taste like that.
I usually ask how thick the chops are....but didn't this time. The side dishes and biscuits were great.
I will keep going to CB bit have learned my lesson to not order the chops.
PS. I did finish my meal but my friend ordered the same entree but only ate one. She was asked if she wanted a box but said it would be a waste of time.  They would be even worse reheated.",Ann Ratay,Local Guide · 42 reviews · 154 photos,3 years ago,4
CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,I've eaten here a few times with my family and the food has always been good for the money. Today I went for a late lunch with my son. There is a young male (host) seating the guests. He used his hand to wipe his face before grabbing our eating utensils that was wrapped in paper napkins. I think this was a gross/nasty way to spread his germs. We asked our waitress to bring us extra napkins.,Major Blue,Local Guide · 108 reviews · 113 photos,5 years ago,3

I always have to get something that has country gravy, whether it be the chicken fried chicken/steak or breakfast with biscuits and gravy. So yummy. I also enjoy brousing through the country store.

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,Even though it is one of my favorite places I can not recommend the fried chicken.

Half of the dumplings were clumped into golfball sized blobs of underdone dough!  First time I've been so disppointed in your signqture dish!  Have you changed your fried okra recipe?

Call in and was put on hold for five minutes and had to hang up. Called in again and was put on hold until a lady came on and took the ordered. Waiting twenty minutes at the establishment and “Ben” came out with the food with two orders of broccoli to replace mashed potatoes that they ran out of a half hour prior! Didn’t even ask anyone what to do,call, or ask on person if that was okay. Sent it back which he then forgot again what the two new sides were that I ordered. Manager apologized but a simple apology will be hard pressed to get me to returned.

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,I really wish I could rate it worse. I use to go to Cracker Barrel every weekend. Steadily our local one has gone down hill until today which broke the camels back and insured I would not return. My “eggs in a basket” was undercooked eggs with burnt toast thrown on top of it. The hash brown casserole was dried out with no moisture at all. The bacon was burnt. The extra side of sasuage I ordered was also burnt. I did not touch the meal and not one person offered a refund.

CrackerBarrelOldCountryStore,"10:26 a.m.
So the waiter and or waitress brings out the beverage as ordered then another waiter brings additional orange juice glasses for me and my daughter. The waiter says guess you get a free orange juice today. The manager comes to the table right after this and ask ""do you want me to charge you for them? If not I am going to take them back."" So in my mind you either are going to throw them away or make an attempt to pass them to another patron once you take them to the rear. At any rate this is poor customer service and piss poor management skills. So management would rather increase food waste and leave a bad taste in a patrons mouth. Now the waiter (Brad) did apologize for the incident so no dig at him.",Sir Knight,Local Guide · 158 reviews · 218 photos,5 years ago,1

ChickFila,"All outside lights were on to show that they were open.   However when I went to the cube to order nobody acknowledged that I was even there.  After waiting for a couple of minutes, the lights went out apparently stating that they were closed.    Why didn't someone just say sorry we are closed but forgot to turn our lights off.    Love Chic filet but will reconsider this location.",Wanda Cupp,Local Guide · 141 reviews · 1 photo,a week ago,5
ChickFila,"I don't think Chick-fil-A is the best, never have but I did think that they had some of the best customer service around. But today I asked if they could keep my chicken sandwich cooking for a little longer because in the past I've had undercooked chicken from this location. I was informed that they cannot fry the chicken any longer for anybody. I just think it's funny that they will change your tire then walk your dog for you in the name of customer service but if you ask them to cook their chicken longer they can not assist 😂",Hunter Barbour,13 reviews · 1 photo,a month ago,3

ChickFila,So I don't know if they're doing something different than Hanover Pennsylvania but for some reason the chicken there just tasted a lot better the other day I kind of want to go back soon and see if it's a consistent thing or maybe I was just extra hungry that night I don't know but it just seem to have more flavor than normal from other locations,Michael Lenahan,Local Guide · 129 reviews · 126 photos,2 months ago,5

ChickFila,"I ordered my salad and asked for ""extra cheese... Like oodles of extra cheese"". I get my food, no extra cheese. I ask for it and the poor guy at the window is told by the kitchen he has to put in an order for it, no one knows how to. Window staff was so polite and wonderful but it took forever until the manager got involved to give me the cheese, then they couldn't figure out what to put it in, or how much to do (im thinking at least the same amount that usually comes) and the photo is what I finally got. Ridiculous.

Again, management, guy at the window was lovely. But way for the kitchen to be total jerks here.",Jennifer Hudson,Local Guide · 69 reviews · 26 photos,2 years ago,2

ChickFila,I absolutely love this! Place the chicken. Here is the best chicken I have ever eaten. I think I would eat there every day if I could. I did eat there like 4 days in a row and I got their chicken sandwich with the pickles on it. My husband gets the crispy chicken  he adds bacon and their macaroni and cheese is so good too. My son likes this place a lot. I used to take him all the time but then I would only order for him usually but then I'm like I should have got something before because I love love love this place and never had a bad meal there ever always good,Amanda Vaillancourt (Mandy),3 reviews · 13 photos,9 months ago,5

ChickFila,"It's a odd mixed bag.  Food is good, exactly as you'd expect.   People are always in a healthy happy frame of mind.  The only thing is every time I  go there the order is short a item or drastically wrong.  If you go and sit in the building your order is perfect.  Every order to go will have a issue, even if you go in and order to go,as done on our last trip, I was missing my Spicy Chicken sandwich.  With a $55.00 bill I kind of expect my food.",Todd,Local Guide · 33 reviews · 9 photos,10 months ago,3

ChickFila,"I actually do not like the food at all,  my taste buds do not react the same way many others do over their food, but my daughter loves their food.

It has always been fresh, the employees are always so sweet and their drive thru skills are amazing!  It's a bit pricey for us, but if you aren't poor and would like a decent chicken sandwich served with a smile, this is definitely the place to go.",Lisa,Local Guide · 43 reviews · 152 photos,11 months ago,5
ChickFila,Fries were not cooked the whole way thru. Sandwich was cold. Cheese was not melted. Tomatoes were not ripe.   They were hard in the middle.  Staff was nice and polite.  Milkshake was good.    This was my first time there.,Michael Rynard,1 review,9 months ago,1

ChickFila,"This is the only location within many miles. The team never disappoints! Always serving everyone with a smile. They are always caring for their customers. They truly mean the ""my pleasure"" they say to everyone. Their delivery person, Orlando, provides top-notch customer service as well. Service for take out, dine in, or delivery via catering is always spot on! People may argue prices being elevated but, if they have the app and know of the rewards program, they'd quickly realize everything from service to the quality of the food to the frequent rewards are totally worth always returning for more!",Rosette Davenport,Local Guide · 19 reviews · 75 photos,a year ago,5

ChickFila,"Been here multiple times over the past year. Only Chick-fil-A in all of America I've been to where the food is consistently cold and soggy when dining in. The chicken even smells a little off. Maybe their oil is bad, either way not appetizing. They often will forget to give you your drinks or sauces. My suggestion would be to go to one in a neighboring town.",Katie Grace,Local Guide · 25 reviews · 140 photos,11 months ago,1
ChickFila,I just wanted to say that I took a few of ur chicken sandwiches home with me put them in the fridge the next day I took the buns off and put some ragu  on them and heated them up in the oven and then put Colby jack cheese on them. End result chicken Parmigian sandwiches and they were amazing.  I know you guys are fast food but I think I came up with an amazing sandwich that will definitely sell.,Amber Foley,2 reviews,7 months ago,5
ChickFila,Good food fast. The reason Chic-fil-A is a success is because they have high standards that are maintained at every restaurant. The only down side to this location is that the interior is darker than normal.,Trent Anderson,Local Guide · 30 reviews · 42 photos,6 years ago,5
ChickFila,Great food and service. They put you through really fast even when the line is very long. Also if you are feeding a bunch of people try out the catering. Fries are the best.,Brendle Newswanger,Local Guide · 24 reviews,11 months ago,5
ChickFila,"Always a pleasant hassle free place for a meal. Staff is friendly, upbeat, and helpful. Food is always spot on. Love their chicken tendies! Drive through is set-up well with the additional staff to make the process more efficient. Location by 81 makes it an easy stop going into or out of Carlisle.

Much appreciated!,Justin Neal,Local Guide · 502 reviews · 959 photos,a year ago,5
ChickFila,"Very disappointed with this Chick-fil-A and the manager working today. I'm an owner of a tour company which brought a large group of 50 to this location and have done so with many groups multiple times over the years. The first time ever, this manager refused to comp a meal for our driver and spoke to our him unkind regarding this matter.

ChickFila,Place was busy but my order was not heard right and was giving the wrong food I ordered a black and white shake and was giving a cookie and cream not sure how that happened  ordered a deluxe meal and was giving a plain which was fixed before I had a chance to actually say something guess the manager was with in ear shot and quickly fixed the situation and received a free cookie... good job guys food was excellent,Thomas Murphy,Local Guide · 83 reviews · 101 photos,a year ago,4

ChickFila,"For a fast food place they really seem to get it right.  Quick and friendly service, fast table turnover so there's almost never a wait, people helping to ring you out while at the drive through when there is a rush, the place is clean, kid friendly, and the food has been consistently good for fast food.  The downside is probably just how popular it is, so you can expect a crowd during peak hours, but it still isn't much of a hindrance.",Eduardo Rodriguez,Local Guide · 109 reviews · 32 photos,2 months ago,5
ChickFila,Was very relaxing and upbeat atmosphere. There's something different there then at other eating places that you can't find just anywhere. Really like the way you can get ice cream there too. If the children want ice cream with their meal they can take their toy back and exchange it for ice cream! The food was just like we remember!

ChickFila,"I visited this particular Chick-fil-a for the first time a few days and I have to tell you, the staff there sets the bar high! Never have I seen interacted with such a friendly staff. The place may be a fast food restaurant, but it's very much treated like a family restaurant and that alone make returning for the delicious food.
Speaking of the food, I caught a good glimpse of the kitchen when I ordered my food and it was so clean. You can tell that there is a standard of hygiene just from that small peek.

ChickFila,"Chick-fil-A restaurants are like the grandmother of the fast food world. They're always polite, always ready to feed you, and always happy to see you. This location is no different. Working is ample, the restaurant easy to access from the interstate, and the insides are clean and well-kept. As always, the food was great, with the chicken crispy, and the tea sweet. The waffle fries were fresh and hot, and not too salty. It's always a nice change to go to a restaurant where the employees actually like to be there, or at least make you think that.",John Frye,Local Guide · 242 reviews · 694 photos,5 years ago,5
ChickFila,I always go to this cfa and they never messed up my order. But recently they’ve messed my order on two separate occasions.

I did not go back again but was handled appropriately by the manager. Today, the same incorrect order, again. I went back and although it was reimbursed, my sandwich is missing the bacon. It isn't much of a club sandwich without the bacon.

ChickFila,Always love Chick-fil-A. Great food. Happy service. Clean. Friendly environment.  We were at the Carlisle ( Pa) Commons one during rush hour...two lane window service. We dined in. Very organized. Efficient and helpful. Fast. Every worker helpful to each other and the customers. Even had a worker with  broom and dust pan keeping it clean.  Kept condiments filled. Pleasant atmosphere...calm. not   noisy.  Play area for children. Love that employees have Sundays with their families to worship God if they wish or just enjoy the day together. I had grilled  chicken sandwich meal and my husband had the regular #1 sandwich on the menu.,Linda Turner,Local Guide · 222 reviews · 285 photos,4 years ago,5

ChickFila,"The only problem we had, was the fries were barely warm, and tough!!! Tasted as if they sat for a  while, before being served! When i complained, the lady at the register never apologized or offered any replacement! Needless to say, won't order waffle fries there again!!! We ended up throwing away 3 orders of fries!!! Everything else was great though!!!!",Christine Ricker,Local Guide · 56 reviews,5 years ago,4

ChickFila,"Absolutely, hands down the best spicy chicken sandwich i have ever eaten. I mean it. It couldve been any meal, the employees must be instilled with integrity because the ratio of juicey x spicy ÷ care equals 5 star",Kevin Fordham,Local Guide · 32 reviews,2 years ago,5
ChickFila,"Terrible! It is the first day of the New Year and I am highly disappointed.  I've been planing to get breakfast since yesterday and not only did you open late at 10:30am, but y'all started directly with the lunch menu. So while I am mourning the untimely death of Betty White, I can't even enjoy the breakfast that I've been craving in order to sooth my soul. This is unacceptable and it shouldn't happen again.

If you decide to open late, you should be considerate enough to serve a late breakfast.",Empress Locs & Coils,Local Guide · 91 reviews · 48 photos,2 years ago,1
ChickFila,This is the second worst Chick-Fil-A I’ve been too. I requested an order of fries with my breakfast order instead of hash browns. The employee stranded I couldn’t order them before 11am. Any other Chick-Fil-A would make this exception for the customer’s order.,Rollin Benson,10 reviews,2 years ago,1
ChickFila,We always have a good experience but today it felt like I was at the McDonald’s line. Order a child’s meal and she went on to ask “anything else” with an attitude. She asked that 3 times. Paid with card .. and got to the payment part of the line and was asked to pay again. Girl who took or order questioned us if we really paid.. then proceeded to say “oh it probably didn’t go through and i didn’t realize it” so we paid AGAIN. Checked our bank account and we had 2 different amounts on the bank account. Usually would’ve let it slide because their customer service is great but not today with that attitude.,Pamela Ortiz,7 reviews,2 years ago,1

ChickFila,"I normally have pleasant experiences at this location but today was a different story...

The woman at the window (blonde, maybe late 30s) was very rude, passive aggressive, overfilled our drinks to the point where they spilled over onto us. I personally work as a server at a café so I try to give the people who serve our food an easy time as I understand... so I cant understand what we would have done to deserve this treatment. But it has made me just slightly hesitant to return to this location...",Rayna Isabella,9 reviews,4 years ago,3
ChickFila,"I love the food at Chick-fil-A. I would add, however, that I've tried a number of breakfast entrees during a promotional period and I wouldn't go for breakfast. The food was well prepared, but chicken on a biscuit isn't what I wouldn't normally want got breakfast, and the things I would get would be cheaper at a competitor. My favorite is definitely the spicy chicken sandwich. Amazing.",Daniel Friess,Local Guide · 61 reviews · 312 photos,4 years ago,5
ChickFila,"They are immensely sluggish in their service to customers, we were the only people in the drive through line, and it took them 15 min to serve us. The bread for the chicken minis was not fully baked on 3 separate visits. Also, meat portion sizes for sandwiches and strips are noticeably smaller than other restaurants in the chain.",Yolanda Ingram,3 reviews,6 years ago,1

ChickFila,"first time at chick fila.  Food is really good.  I'm impressed with how fresh and well cooked the food is.  So I finished my meal and I'm sitting here reading the news on my phone and any older gentleman who works here offered to take my tray.  I said thank you.  He asked if I would like a refill of my coke, and where typically I would politely decline, I have a half hour to kill and I'm a little thirsty, so I said sure.  He took my cup and went up and got me a refill, when he brought it back he smiled and genuinely said ""thanks for coming in"".  I only choose to cone here today because it's my pastor's favorite place and so I wanted to see why.  Now I see why.  I'll definitely be back often.",Matthew Seth,Local Guide · 106 reviews · 2 photos,6 years ago,5

ChickFila,"I have been to this Chick-fil-A twice—once a few days ago and once tonight. The first order was wrong—they gave me a spicy sandwich instead of a regular one, and some of the fries had a moldy taste to them. I gave that up to a freak thing, but Then again tonight I had fries that tasted moldy!! Super gross. It ruined my meal completely—I had to throw the rest away! I love Chick-fil-A but something is wrong with your potatoes.",Ally Mahon,3 reviews,3 years ago,2
ChickFila,"I love Chik-fil-A. Their service is almost always fast and enjoyable. Although, this particular time that we went they messed up our order.

ChickFila,Don't get in the drive thru line unless you really mean it. There is no way to get around the other cars. You can't drive all the way around the building. The service inside was friendly and fast though. They dealt with a large crowd very quickly and smoothly.,Tony Floyd,Local Guide · 136 reviews · 51 photos,5 years ago,4
ChickFila,The good was fine..you get what you pay for but the lady taking our money at the window was so completely inappropriate that my wife ended up getting out of the car!! In the drive thru! This girl was so vulgar it made my skin crawl. Does Chic-fil- A not train their employees to interact with the public?! Never again!,Job Lewis,Local Guide · 14 reviews,5 years ago,3

ChickFila,I mainly only eat chicken. So going to a restaurant that only serves chicken I would think it would be fantastic chicken. Wrong! My grandmother's sandwich was so dry and chicken tough. Mine was cold. Soda fountain machine needs carbonation adjusted. Service was not horrible but attitudes needed adjusted that's for sure.,A G,82 reviews · 3 photos,6 years ago,2
ChickFila,"This place is packed like a metro station in China. There are kids everywhere running around with their shoes off. It's loud. The staff leaned over my table to clean the windows and sprayed Windex when I was still eating. Food is always good though and despite being packed it gets to your table in a timely manner. Rated a 3, but that's a light 3. Go to Firehouse Subs or Five Guys in the same plaza for a better experience.",Coty Laird,Local Guide · 14 reviews · 6 photos,6 years ago,3

Asked for chic fil la sauxe and they failed to put it in the bag and there were only 7 nuggets on an 8 pc and the fries were barely even filled in the box. Usually don't have to check the bag at chic fil la nor have to worry about the order being messed up but I guess location matters. This would have never happned at the Mechanicsburg location. Definitely disappointed.",Megan Brickner,2 reviews,6 years ago,1
ChickFila,"I sold my chicken Jenni to a farm nearby that supposedly supplied some of Chick-fil-a's chickens. I am glad that her memory lives on in Chik-Fil-A's respectful sandwiches. She was a good chicken. I know they say chickens don't have empathy (as they used to be dinosaurs, wake up America!!!) but I like to believe Jenni did. She would often bring me lizards she caught when I was upset. This often made things much worse, as lizards are sacred in my religion, but I appreciated the sentiment all the same. She liked to drink pond water and caw at the moonrise. My favorite memory is when she bit Jake Sullivan's legs when he tried to sneak through our gate to stuff lemons from our lemon tree in his mouth like a gerbil. I hated Jake. He broke my D.S when I was 12 at summer camp and then told our camp counselor I was the one who had shoved all the canoes down stream when it was clearly him. R.I.P Jenni.

I ordered when I got there and the cashier was friendly and  prompt. I got the #Goose which is a sample platter of Ribs, Brisket, Pulled Pork, Quarter Chicken, with Beans and Rice and two side of your choice. The food was done quick and I sat at the picnic bench tables outside. The food was good and it was so much that I didn't get to finish it. They took credit card and it was a smooth transaction.",Donnell Halford,"Local Guide · 157 reviews · 1,002 photos",a year ago,5
PBsKitchenwithSouthernSmoke,"I’m not even sure what this is supposed to be but it’s definitely not southern. I have lived in the south my whole life and I’ve never eaten anything that tastes like this. And taste is all I did, this food isn’t edible. Baked beans are definitely from a can, probably Walmart brand, red beans and rice, if I had to guess… maybe uncle ben’s from the box??? The meat tastes boiled and unseasoned then heated on the grill and some sauce spread on top after. And please do not get me started on that mac&cheese…. If that’s what it really is, definitely doesn’t look like mac&cheese. Wow I really hope this isn’t what you all think southern food tastes like. Even more, I really hope you all don’t think this is good. Please get your taste buds checked. Plus had the order delivered by DoorDash and the driver was so rude and didn’t follow any instructions, left my food on a park bench in front of a store instead of bringing it to me like I asked in the app. Come on PA I know you all can do better than this!",Cristy Griffin,6 reviews · 27 photos,a year ago,1
PBsKitchenwithSouthernSmoke,"These guys are nice and fast, but not my favorite BBQ spot. The beans are VERY sugary/sweet. The mac is VERY cheesy. The meat was pretty fatty. The sandwiches aren't loaded with meat so not worth the price in my opinion. Still a decent spot to grab some bbq.",Dave Fleming,Local Guide · 163 reviews · 242 photos,a year ago,3
PBsKitchenwithSouthernSmoke,"Great food, affordable price, and very friendly service. They have recently expanded the location from the grill out back to a much bigger store and it looks awesome!

PBsKitchenwithSouthernSmoke,"We had original BBQ brisket sandwich...
The brisket was OK as it's tender & moist,  but it needs more BBQ sauce 😍

PBsKitchenwithSouthernSmoke,"Got the ""Goose"" with Mac and cheese and baked beans. Both sides were very good. Chicken was super juicy. Ribs were flavorful with a good bark, but a little tough. Rice has a bit of a kick, but really good flavor. Sausage was good. Food was quoted to take 10 mins and came out in 3. Super nice workers",Jae Hill,Local Guide · 43 reviews · 35 photos,3 years ago,4
PBsKitchenwithSouthernSmoke,Very Good Eat-in & Take Out Restaurant. Hospitality is really GOOD. The Food is very Delicious. I'm not sure if they have Delivery because that wasn't the option that I used personally but definitely a Great spot to eat at.,Mr. Marcus D.,8 reviews · 1 photo,a year ago,5
PBsKitchenwithSouthernSmoke,"Found this spot while on my truck route. Staff is very friendly and food is amazing! I had the ribs, pulled pork, Mac and cheese, and baked beans. I have no cons about this place. Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing! Don't think about going here, just do it! Hands down best smokehouse I've ever been too and I'm a trucker so I've been to many smokehouses in multiple states. Also near truck stop so you can bobtail over and park cab in there parking lot",Producer717,2 reviews,a year ago,5
PBsKitchenwithSouthernSmoke,"Food was very very good. Nice portions. Extremely flavorful. Husband was surprised how good it was as we've had others that did not impress us. We had the pork, brisket, smoked Mac and cheese, baked beans with brisket and red beans and rice. I also got a bowl of the gumbo on rice. We seriously could not say one bad thing. Delicious.... definitely going back again. Also people were so friendly and welcoming.",Wendy Wickard,8 reviews,a year ago,5

PBsKitchenwithSouthernSmoke,"We stopped for lunch on our way back home to Ohio from our first trip to NYC. Actually we drove passed and saw it, and we turned around to go back. My boyfriend and I decided to get one meal to split, we chose the cheese steak sandwich with provolone, peppers, and onions. It came with fries (we added cheese) and a drink, we had a tea. It was a huge meal, and it was delicious. It was plenty for the both of us, we had fries left over. Prices aren't too bad, and worth every single penny. Definitely recommend!",Chasity Marie,Local Guide · 10 reviews · 3 photos,a year ago,5

The drinks and the atmosphere is all right",James,Local Guide · 63 reviews · 4 photos,a year ago,1
PBsKitchenwithSouthernSmoke,"Being from SC, I’ve had my share of BBQ places. I wouldn’t say this is true BBQ. The baked beans on the menu stated they have brisket and hamburger meat inside of it, I only saw one small speck of ground beef in the baked beans. They were overly sweetened with brown sugar.  All you can taste is old bay in the mac and cheese. The quantity of meat that was placed in the sandwich wasn’t a lot. Wouldn’t recommend for someone who’s from the South and knows good BBQ.",Rollin Benson,10 reviews,a year ago,1
PBsKitchenwithSouthernSmoke,This business is owned by a personal friend so I suppose I'm a little bias. But it doesn't change the fantastic food.  I like the Brisket myself but everything they offer is good. Home cooked.  Mac and cheese. Pasta salads. Bakes beans with bacon. Lots of great sides. Great bbg and other homemade sauces.

PBsKitchenwithSouthernSmoke,"When looking for good barbecue, it's usually the road-side shack that have the best offerings. This place is no exception. Good, smokey ribs that leave your fingers smelling of smoke afterwards. Only thing I'd change is the lack of real hot-links ...but that's a pretty common lack outside of Memphis, it seems.

PBsKitchenwithSouthernSmoke,"I'm pretty picky and unimpressed by most of the eateries that have high ratings in Carlisle, but I'm giving PB's 5 stars.  The night we tried them, they were sold out of many types of meat (apparently a warehouse placed a big order for their workers that day) so we ended up only being able to order the chicken cheese steak and roast beef sandwiches. I was expecting mediocrity but was surprised with excellent flavor and well made sandwiches at a fair price.  We split the CCS between two of us b.c it was huge. They are experiencing some growing pains so be patient (a sure sign that the product is worthwhile) and the hours of operation are short for the restaurant business so plan ahead. They close at 6pm which is when most people are just beginning to think about what's for dinner.  We are looking forward to going back soon to try the brisket, the burgers and the sides.",Karen Rowe,8 reviews · 3 photos,3 years ago,5

A warm, friendly greeting by the owner and chef welcomed us. The menu includes plenty of tempting choices although I am especially drawn to “The Rockefeller” since I love a good pastrami sandwich. Toasted rye, plenty of meat, cheese and just the perfect amount of spicy mustard makes this the best pastrami in the area. The other people in our group loved their choices.  We will become regulars.

TheSunriseCafeSandwichShop,"Probably my favorite Sandwich Shop in America. Hi, I'm Jared and my partner and I travel quite a bit for work. We have a great client in the Carlisle area, who suggested we have lunch here at The Sunrise Cafe. So glad he brought us here.

This spot is in a historic house in the downtown district, and the owner makes what just has to be the most delicious, balanced and perfect sandwiches I have ever eaten. I have eaten them all over the country including the hot spots like Miami, NYC, Boston, Los Angeles, Las Vegas etc... nope. This little spot in Carlisle is the best one of them all.

Every little detail of each sandwich here is thoughtful and compliments the other. The staff is helpful and pleasant, and the owner herself seems to magically appear and greet guests before disappearing back into her impeccable kitchen. She has an alpha chick gusto that remains me of a modern day Rosie the riveter. All very good vibes here.

Probably the most incredible thing I have noticed in my visits here is the cleanliness of the kitchen. On my most recent visit I saw the door to it was wide open as we exited. I could not help put peer inside, and to my dismay the kitchen was spotless. Every counter was clean, every bottle was facing the same direction, everything was nearly arranged on the shelves. This was not just clean, this was surgical. Exact. You would think she was getting he place ready to be on HGTV or be inspected by Gordon Ramsay or something.

Nope. Just another day at work for Sunrise Cafe.

Trust me folks, no normal human has a kitchen this precise or this clean. Only someone with massive discipline and consistency would operate this way. This is exactly the kind of chef who would create the best sandwiches you have ever eaten in your life.

I live in Texas, so I may only have a chance to eat here once every couple of years, but if you are reading this and considering going in there because you re in the area: stop reading.

We discovered and enjoyer Sunrise while we were stationed temporarily at Carlisle Barracks but since then we have sent people to this spot from 400+ miles away and have not heard a single bad review from friends we have sent. The staff work so hard here and have really created something special- check them out and dine in the historic little dining area, or sandwiches are also great to carry out!",Andrea K,19 reviews,3 months ago,5
TheSunriseCafeSandwichShop,"Big City sandwich bistro meets Carlisle!

This place is way too good for this city. Food is always delicious and on point. The menu is a labor of love and one of my favorite places to eat. And the atmosphere is perfect for meeting with friends or a first date.",HaileYesus Bairu,Local Guide · 174 reviews · 158 photos,a year ago,5
TheSunriseCafeSandwichShop,"Food is very good.  Bagels are excellent and cooked to order.

Loses 1 star due to very limited hours.  I think that they are catering towards retirees since they don't open until 8 am and close at lunch time.  I do not work from home and start before 8 am so breakfast is out.  They close at 12:45 pm so unless you eat an early lunch, lunch service won't work.  Hopefully, they will extend their hours.",Steve m,1 review,3 months ago,4
TheSunriseCafeSandwichShop,"The food was underwhelming, lacked flavor, and slow to arrive for a simple egg sandwich.  Furthermore, the help was very matter of fact about not having recycling stating ""no, we don't recycle and, no, we can't do anything about it.""

Edit: Reply from the owner kinda sums up the vibe I got from going there - basically ""if you don't like it, go somewhere else"" as opposed to taking the feedback and trying to improve to appeal to a broader base.  And ""slow to arrive for a simple egg sandwich"" was based upon a 20 minute wait for an egg sandwich (yes it was vegetarian and yes it was underwhelming) when there was only 1 other table sat there.  Also pretty rude to implythat I don't understand the difference between vegetarian and vegan. I wasn't saying that you didn't have vegetarian offerings but rather that I wouldn't recommend them to a vegetarian.  Your response only further affirms to me and to those reading this review that your establishment is not welcoming. I had you at 2 stars because it was an honest review. Your response has just made my experience even worse and I'm dropping the review to a 1 star as a result.",Giuseppe Collia,Local Guide · 16 reviews,3 months ago,1
TheSunriseCafeSandwichShop,This was my first time stopping here for a breakfast sandwich but it will not be my last. They had a bunch of orders before me but it was well worth the wait.

TheSunriseCafeSandwichShop,"The Tommy sandwich is my favorite. The grilled donut ""bun"" is genius. I live in Indiana and every time I visit Carlisle I look forward to a ""Tommy"".

TheSunriseCafeSandwichShop,I am visiting Carlisle for work and came across this cute sandwich shop. I was able to customize my order from any item on the menu I had breakfast and it was honestly probably the best food I’ve had in Carlisle in the 2 weeks I have been here. Only thing was the bacon was a little crispier than I like but I’m sure if I had expressed that it wouldn’t have been an issue. Owner was really nice as well.,Kelli Washington,19 reviews,7 months ago,4
TheSunriseCafeSandwichShop,"Took a very long time to receive our order and the order ended up being incorrect. The food itself was good and the person working the register was polite and apologetic about the long wait time. Seemed like there were a lot of regular customers coming in and out (some of whom ordered at the counter after us and then received their food before us). Also slightly confusing signs saying no outside food or drink is allowed but then also saying they don't have specialty drinks and if you would like one you should get it elsewhere and bring it with you. I assume part of the trouble of my visit was because I went on a Sunday morning, and the food itself was not bad. So, overall my experience was 2 stars. I am not excited to go back but would be willing to give it another chance on a different day if a friend really wanted me to.

EDIT: Changing my review to 1 star based on the rude response received from the owner.  I leave honest reviews on Google based purely on my experiences.  Several owners have responded to my reviews improving my experience, or inviting me to come back and try again and, in doing so, has improved my experience with their business.  This one has done the opposite and instead, because I had a bad experience and shared it with others, essentially said I shouldn't ever return to potentially have a better one?",Brent Keath,Local Guide · 29 reviews,4 weeks ago,1
TheSunriseCafeSandwichShop,"I have never been so quick to write a 5-star review! I came in for the first time this morning (I'm visiting) and got the Tommy! It may have been the best breakfast sandwich I have ever eaten in my life (nothing in Carlisle even comes close)!! Perfectly sweet and salty (kind of like a McGriddle, but 10x better!). The cafe itself is super cute, bright, and charming and the service was great--like Sunshine :)! There were a few regulars in there, so this the kind of place that people love. I cannot recommend enough!!! I will be back in before I head home!!!",Claire Marie,6 reviews,8 months ago,5

TheSunriseCafeSandwichShop,My first time coming in with my husband abd 2 year old for breakfast and the owner was so nice and personable. She turned the heat on in the back and turned off the fireplace just so the baby wouldn't hurt herself. She answered every question I had and made time for me even though she does everything herself. As a sole owner to this shop she is so attentive to her customers and loves her business. Definitely my new favorite place. Will be coming a lot more.

TheSunriseCafeSandwichShop,"The space is very cozy and quite nice on the inside and the owner was very very sweet. The ingredients were also very fresh which I appreciated. And being from Philadelphia I have no problem paying a premium for fresh ingredients. My only constructive criticism is that at the price point I paid the bagel breakfast sandwich should of had two eggs on it, not just one. One egg over an entire NY style bagel just does not cut it and the avocado was a little underwhelming as well. The flavors were fresh. Maybe my Philadelphia expectations are set too high. The owner is nice though, so I will try it again.",Eric Clay Warner,Local Guide · 28 reviews · 7 photos,2 years ago,4

TheSunriseCafeSandwichShop,My grandmother had trouble reading the menu. The placement of items and pricing was very confusing. The descriptions of the food did not match the actual food once served. I ordered the Healthy breakfast and the avocado smash as written on the menu was actually just avocado mayo. It also did not specify it would be served as a sandwich. Not a great experience since the place is new but there is great potential and room for improvement. Prices were great.,Isabel Blumenthal,6 reviews,4 years ago,3
TheSunriseCafeSandwichShop,"I'll start off by saying I'll try this restaurant again...but for my first visit, it was a bit of a disappointment.  First off, the pastrami sandwich is good, I would've liked an offering of other toppings, secondly, I chose this sandwich because I was told it came with a side of their cole slaw, otherwise I was going to try a different sandwich.  Sadly, once I left the restaurant and got back to work, excited to try my sandwich meal from this new cute restaurant...there was no pickle or coleslaw included with my sandwich.  Should I have checked before I left?  Should I have to?

Finally, the owner and one other were clearly there finishing their lunch, but didn't offer the greeting of the day or even a smile.  Perhaps they were busy, but as a new establishment, my recommendation is to go above and beyond while you are trying to establish a base for clientele.

I appreciate this as a family small business, so I only write this review in hopes that it assists you as you grow your business.

I will be back to try again...",Rabid Fairy8312,2 reviews,4 years ago,2
TheSunriseCafeSandwichShop,"A friend and I stopped in today. The atmosphere was nice. It is very clean and the staff were friendly. The girl at the counter was very sweet but could have been a bit more knowledgeable about the product. However I understand that they have not been open very long and that could be why. I got the quirky Turkey and although it was pretty good I expected a bit more for the price. Maybe a higher quality deli meat? The slaw was ok. Needed a bit more flavor. Also, I didnt ask but maybe an option for free water if that isnt available? Over all it was a good experience and I would like to go back and try breakfast. I love the idea of bringing life to an old building! You did a great job.",Danielle Davis,3 reviews,4 years ago,3

I have never had that happen in any restaurant outside a power failure. Tell people it will take a long time and give them an option to order or not but to refuse to serve?

First time they put the wrong type of eggs on the sandwich,  we just dealt with it since it was a customization request. The second time they gave away the our order that we paid for (the last turnover) while we waited for it to be boxed up to go, made us wait in line again to be told that instead of coming to us when it happened.  Then just said ""sorry we gave it away, I thought there were more.""   Then had to wait again for a refund.  And no other attempts were made to make it right.

Sandwich came on a cold un toasted poppy seed roll and it literally had half a piece of bacon on each side. Menu said it was supposed to be ""thick cut"" but this was paper thin. Place could be a hit with the proper menu and food prepped properly.  The portions you get at the price I can't see it making it in Carlisle PA.

Grazery,"Pretty hipster place. Got the portobello burger. It was good. Side of chips was kinda small for their big tray they serve it to ya in, but I feel like most hipster places are like that.

All three vegetarian dishes are exceptional. Their soup is always on point, regardless of the season. This place could do well in swanky places in California. Even the employees have a California vibe to them!",HaileYesus Bairu,Local Guide · 174 reviews · 158 photos,a year ago,5
Grazery,"My main reason for going this time was the
Walnut & Fig Tart:  Rosemary-scented cream with fig-preserve swirls in a walnut oat crust. Vegan, gluten-free, and made in-house from scratch with figs and rosemary. #veganandglutenfree

But I decided to stay for lunch. I had the
Zucchini  sweet pea and mint soup and the
Sweet Potato stuffed w/ roasted broccoli, arugula, lemon vinaigrette & black sesame seeds which is also vegan and gluten-free.

* I cut up the sweet potato so you can see what was in it but there's another picture for presentation.

The food is reliably good, healthy, and I trust the safety of her kitchen. Today I smiled when I was greeted like an old friend.

Grazery,The food here is absolutely delicious. We had the Greek pita as well as the Tuna sandwich. Hands down was one of the best lunches we've had. The service was just as amazing as the food.

Grazery,I definitely will return.  This resurant is a wonderful experience.  The food was amazing and the staff was pleasant and efficient.  Proper precautions were taken between guests.  I couldn't have asked for a better spot to eat.  Only drawback because nobody's perfect...they close at two.  Closing early probably gives them time to prep that yummy food and enjoy their family.  I loved it.,alesha hatcher,11 reviews · 4 photos,a year ago,5

Grazery,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this amazing little gem in Downtown Carlisle.

This is our goto lunch spot.  I have a slight addiction to the Mellow Bird sandwich with popcorn on the side.  Everything here is incredibly fresh, and the service and personal attention Maria and Yani pay to their customers is off the charts.  (Honestly, some of the best customer service I have ever experienced in Carlisle.)

When I do deviate from my standard order, I have never been disappointed,  whether it is creative and healthy salads or any of their other sandwich or wrap options.   They always have fresh homemade soup options that, once again, never disappoint.

Hey guys, don't be thrown off by the  ""Healthy Food"" moniker here, this is just good food.

Keep up the great work Grazery!",Mark Mcnutt,Local Guide · 37 reviews · 3 photos,7 months ago,5
Grazery,"This place is great, if you like the concept of Panera you'll love this place, except that you'll be able to taste flavorful food here (ha, sorry). Half sald/soup/sandwich is perfect, in a perfect location, everyone who works there has been so welcoming to us.

My one qualm. Carlisle has a lack of restaurants with healthy, veg heavy options, ESPECIALLY food joints like this open on the weekend. I'm dying for lunch hours on the weekend. I will do your dishes the first weekend you're open.",Chad Greenlee,Local Guide · 75 reviews · 2 photos,a year ago,5

Grazery,Hostess were both very rude. They were very busy and the wait was long when I went and understand why I couldn’t get a table. It wouldn’t bother me if I was treated like an actual customer. I guess they think if they’ve made enough money for the day they don’t have to treat their potential customers with any sort of respect. I didn’t get a chance the try the food here and definitely won’t be bothering to come back after the way the hostess spoke to me. Ran down to the Caribbean place down the street and had much much better service and the food was great. Check it out!,Haley K,2 reviews,a year ago,1
Grazery,"Always fresh food and friendly service. Our server checked with the chef to be sure ingredients would not cause an allergic reaction. Seating is limited and COVID protocols are enforced. Great atmosphere, delicious food, wonderful place for lunch. Try the soup (any of them) and my favorite sandwich is the Mediterranean. Vegan and Gluten Free options on menu.

Today we tried out the Lunch menu and absolutely loved it. I got the Greek Pita with shredded lamb and it was delicious. The Spring Me Up salad was also delightful..I never describe food as delightful. The chocolate raspberry vinaigrette was something I couldn’t put my finger on and definitely would not have considered to put on a salad.

Cannot recommend this place enough!",Mike Palmieri,4 reviews,3 years ago,5
Grazery,This is my first time ordering from here and it is very delicious. I appreciate the gluten and vegan free options. It is difficult to find those accommodating options in Carlisle. I would definitely be ordering from here again. The only thing I would mention is price is fairly high. I got a sandwich and half salad for $18. I normally wouldn’t buy food for that cost but it’s something new to try. Overall good experience.,B Michelle,15 reviews,3 years ago,4

Grazery,"Everything was amazing here! I wish they would open a location in Seattle, where I live. They would do amazingly there! The carrot and ginger purée soup was bowl-licking delicious (I seriously had to hold back from doing so) and the kale farro salad was equally stunning, both in flavor and appearance. They have a wonderful selection of pantry goods that I will come back for before I return to Seattle. Well-worth the visit!",Dawn Chesbro,Local Guide · 15 reviews,2 years ago,5

Would highly recommend coming with friends and family. 🙂🙂💙💙💙💙,Cece Fern,1 review,4 years ago,5

Grazery,Very good food with great selection. There are multiple gluten free and vegan options available. The only downside is the very very limited hours of operation.

One13Social,"We stopped in for a drink and some appetizers and we're very impressed. They have some very nice options and we are looking forward to trying the dinner menu soon. I had the Draper which was good, but was expecting a little more of a traditional old fashioned, but it wasn't quite that, but still good. The One13 fries were very good and I'd recommend them. We sat at the front bar which was nice and quiet, and walked back to the larger bar which also looked nice.",Matt Bitner,Local Guide · 476 reviews · 923 photos,5 days ago,5
One13Social,"My wife and I ate here recently. We had reservations and sat at the bar, waiting for our table and ended up actually eating dinner at the bar and gave up our reservation in the dining room. The service was absolutely amazing there and the vibe was really cool.the food was out of this world, cocktails were on point and they had a very nice wine list.  Really enjoyed the espresso martinis and all of the entrées were delicious. This is one of our new favorite restaurants in Carlisle for sure. We will definitely be back!",Chad Adams,"Local Guide · 127 reviews · 1,697 photos",3 weeks ago,5
One13Social,"This is a fabulous restaurant! Our waiter, Morgan, was patient, knowledgeable and attentive. The atmosphere is very pleasant and best of all, the food is amazing! I highly recommend (with many others) the Korean BBQ ribs. And the Brussels sprouts were so tasty. These two ""small plates"" were not small! My wife had the Florentino Chicken.

And for dessert, Morgan's recommendation, we split a piece of peanut butter pie. The name does not mention the delicious Oreo crust, the crushed peanut butter cup drizzled on top, nor the fact that it is a light fluffy mouse of a pie. Simply delicious. You won't regret it!

A great place to celebrate our 28th wedding anniversary!",David Nakhla,24 reviews · 14 photos,3 months ago,5
One13Social,"My only gripe is the cost per portion is often underwhelming. That being said, if you're willing to pay an upcharge for excellent service, meticulously crafted drinks, and a great atmosphere, the food is certainly tasty enough to justify it. If you want to try it out without getting hit with a high bill, the skinny fries and Don Draper drink really hit the spot.",Dave Fleming,Local Guide · 163 reviews · 242 photos,6 months ago,4

One13Social,"Fantastic dining experience. Our first visit was on our 20th wedding anniversary. We consider ourselves ""foodies"" but do not get to Carlisle often. This has been on our list, and our anniversary was a great excuse to make the trek and check it out. One13 Social did NOT disappoint! The fried Brussels app was just fantastic. The scampi gnocchi entree was pretty good (fresh, house made gnocchi) but the Chicken Florentine was incredible. Like, seriously incredible. Cocktails were excellent as well. We can't wait to return.

One13Social,"One13 Social has an excellent atmosphere and a warm aesthetic; my wife said it reminded her of a nice restaurant on Maryland’s eastern shore. While we ate in the dining room, we peaked our heads into the bar, which seemed cozy and a great place to hang out. Next time, we might go straight to the bar.

Our service was also great, with a young server who checked on us occasionally but wasn’t constantly bothering us, which is what we like.

The food was mostly good. We started with the fried oysters, which we were excellent, and the mussels in marinara special. The mussels were very good, but the marinara sauce was less impressive, with a strong olive flavor. For an entree, we got the scampi gnocchi. Unfortunately, the gnocchi was not very flavorful and was doughy, which is not what we’re used to.

My wife had wine, and I had two very good cocktails- the Draper and the Irish coffee. Both were satisfying in their own way.

One13 Social checked most of our boxes, and we will be back, chalking up the issue with the gnocchi to either a mistake or a dish prepared in a way that we don’t prefer.",Andy Hoover,Local Guide · 25 reviews · 21 photos,3 months ago,4
One13Social,"My husband and I have been here several times. The atmosphere has a great vibe, the service is impeccable and the food is amazing!  We’ve tried many things on the menu and all were scrumptious.  A few of our favorites are the grilled oysters, fried mozzarella, the Gem Lettuce salad with a smash burger and fries. The peanut butter pie and drinks are exceptional.

One13Social,"A welcome surprise in Carlisle.  They don’t take reservations so be prepared to wait or utilize their call ahead list. Great server! The food was a solid 4-stars.  The server knew food, drink and the menu.  The food just didn’t hit it out of the park.  The She-crab soup was just a little off and the Shrimp Gnocchi was bland.  The gnocchi themselves were very dense, too dense.  Packed with calories I’m sure but, my standard is little pillows of deliciousness.    I had to add salt to the meal and left some behind.  Something I very rarely do.  Worth a trip if you’re in the area but keep working on your culinary game.",Peter and Lisa Roberts,29 reviews · 4 photos,2 months ago,4

In order to keep the surprise, they only brought 4 waters out and didn't bring the highchair to the table. About 20 minutes into drinks, my sister and brother in law showed with my year old nephew. It was really sweet for the staff to go the extra step on a busy Saturday night. The meals and drinks were also fantastic. Thanks so much for helping to surprise me!",Becky J.,25 reviews · 6 photos,a month ago,5
One13Social,"Food was fantastic. Cocktails were good as well. I asked our waiter to tell the bartender to make a “bourbon cocktail of their choice” (since they only had one bourbon cocktail on their specialty cocktail list). I received an old fashioned with a Woodford Reserve barrel select bourbon. To my surprise, I was met with a $38 charge on my bill for that requested cocktail. All the specialty cocktails are $13-$15. I was left irritated and confused. I guess it’s my fault for not specifying a specific price range. However, who really wants to pay for a $40 cocktail?",Garrett Westra,3 reviews,3 months ago,3

One13Social,"I’ve eaten at this restaurant before with friends when I was in town visiting my father. It’s somewhat upscale for the area. I bought my 93 year old father there night and he tripped over the step at the entrance and fell. The staff did not offer to help and pretended it didn’t happen. My father insisted he was okay. We were offered a seat near the kitchen where it’s difficult for a 93 year old man to hear and had to ask to move to a quieter spot. The waitress was entirely mechanical and none of the staff seemed to be able to smile. I’ve done well in life, traveled the world, and seen many things and people, but I’ve never felt so insignificant or experienced such mechanical and uncaring service as I experienced at this restaurant tonight. Unless you are totally obtuse and self involved or intimidated to the extent you think you’re not worth treating well, don’t go to this restaurant with any level of expectation of a good service experience. The service approach was terrible and I got the distinct impression the servers were expected to  behave that way. As I looked around, it wasn’t only our waitress. All the servers seemed to behaved as nothing more than order-processing robots. I was appalled.
I hope my father is okay after his fall there. Time will tell because he was shamed for it so won’t disclose if he’s hurt. What is certain is no one at One Social cares either way… The service staff behaves are nothing more than robots who believe obtuse and aloof service is professional and upscale, which couldn’t be more wrong. It is ignorant and in the case of my father’s fall tight, absolutely deplorable. I’ll never go back and I hope you won’t go either knowing you’re paying to support a business where everything from a 93 year old man falling to the average patron ordering means absolutely nothing other than a trendy reputation and a dime. The food isn’t good enough to patronize that.",P G,5 reviews,2 months ago,1

One13Social,"Great little place! Brought my sister here for late afternoon snacks and cocktails. Pictures: smoked goat bread, fries with salsa Verde and garlic aioli, the Chloe cocktail, and the Carlisle Sour. It definitely is on the more expensive side, but is great quality. I would consider it a splurge boutique restaurant. (Cocktails are all $13-$16) Staff was friendly and attentive. The building is really interesting, I would love to learn more about it. Only negatives: fries weren't quite worth the price, larger water cups would be nice (ours were filled 4 times I think), and perhaps mark the bathrooms a little more clearly. That's it, though! I would highly recommend.",Brynn Kelly,Local Guide · 43 reviews · 61 photos,a year ago,5
One13Social,"5 stars indeed. I have been chomping at the bit to get in here and I was NOT disappointed! Not a single detail was overlooked in this wonderful spot. The food, the service, the drinks, the atmosphere! All amazing.  Everything looked so uniquely delicious it was hard to pick so we decided on a tour of the appetizers instead of one big meal. 6 total plus desserts and all were superb (the tuna tostada was my favorite).  As a frequent visitor to downtown Carlisle, I have a few favorite spots. I am thrilled to add One13 Social to the list. They fired on all cylinders and I cannot recommend them enough.

One13Social,"One13 Social is a beautiful place, with nice servers but very subpar entrees. The salmon was very underdone or so frozen that when we got it, it was complete mush.

One13Social,"I had a disappointing meal today. My friend and I made the grave mistake of getting the Carwood Smash Burger. The burger was cooked at best at medium rare (I assumed it would have been fully cooked), the bun was so greasy that grease was dripping from our burgers and was all over our plate. I only ate a few bites and I didn’t eat any of the side and the waitress never asked anything about it. Highly disappointed.

One13Social,"Mixed review. One13 Social had a great atmosphere and very friendly staff. The food was prepared quickly despite it being a fairly crowded time. My wife got the Tuna Tostada which was presented very well and appeared to be cooked properly. It was excellently flavored 9\10 on that. I made the mistake of getting the Carwood Smash burger. It seemed to be cooked somewhat decently (I asked for medium rare) but I was very disappointed with the quality. The meat seemed cheap and had many unswallowable bites, plus the flavor was very bland. 3\10... 2 stars for the overall experience, would've been better if I ordered a better dish.",Buddy Fuller,3 reviews,a year ago,2
One13Social,"Great place! Awesome atmosphere,  food was incredible I got the chicken Florentine best I've ever had. Only complaint would be that our waitress was not very knowledgeable about the few menu questions we had,  she did not really introduce herself or feel very comfortable talking to us.  For the amount you pay and the elegance of the restaurant I expected more out of our server. I overheard a male server behind us that seemed much better wish we had gotten him.",Chelsea Rubalcaba,5 reviews,2 years ago,4

One13Social,"Note: price included drinks.
New place (open about a month when we were there.) It was very busy, and not for lack of staff.  There was about a 1 hour wait at 6pm. We were told no reservations, but they DO accept call ahead seating, up to 30 minutes in advance.  The building, previously known as The Brick, was renovated and expanded.  It was obvious that there had been a lot of effort to increase the capacity, while maintaining a nice upscale environment.

We started at one of the two bars with a couple of drinks while we waited.  Craft beers and wine were priced at the higher end of average, but service was fast.

We decided to have a light meal.  I had a smash burger, which was awesome.  Two others in our party had some kind of shrimp skewers, and the last person in our party had a chicken filet sandwich.  Everyone enjoyed what they ate.  Service was reasonably fast and attentive.  The owner stopped at our table to make sure everything was being taken care of properly.

There was also a nice selection of dinner entrees which sounded very appealing, so we will be going back to try them.  The owner told us that these entrees may change depending upon feedback and popularity.

Overall, it was a great experience.  Next time we'll call ahead to reduce our wait to be seated.  I recommend this restaurant, and I believe you will enjoy it.  Sadly, I took no photos.  (Sorry!)

To the owner and staff, thank you!",Pete M.,Local Guide · 44 reviews · 26 photos,2 years ago,5

We had chips with queso and salsa.  Chips were authentic, queso was queso, and the salsa was on the vinegar side but it was fresh; 5 stars.  I got a burrito and it was outstanding, 5 stars.  She got tacos and said they were just OK, 3 stars.

TaqueriaLaurita,"Food is excellent and often service is pretty good. Today I was told I would need to wait outside for my order and take it to go because I have a service dog. My dog was leashed, harnessed, and carried in a shoulder pouch. No making any noise or disturbing anyone. I realize some people do not love dogs but I need my dog to be able to live a full life. Legally under ADA this business needs to comply and allow well behaved service dogs in their business. I didn’t make a big deal as I was with my elderly mother I went and waited outside while she waited for food. This might not seem like a big deal but issues like this happen all the time to disabled people and it makes our life harder. It makes disabled people feel like they don’t deserve to participate in the same activities because we need assistance from our service dogs. I love the food here but I won’t be coming back for that reason.",Colelea Lea,4 reviews,8 months ago,2

TaqueriaLaurita,"This place is very inauthentic. I am very disappointed in everything I ordered. The ""very hot salsa"" is not even a little hot. The ""chips"" were stale. The tortillas they use for tacos were store bought and not cooked all the way. The burrito was not authentic. If you like mexican food you do not want to eat here. If there are any actual Mexican or Latino owners or staff I would be ashamed of what they are serving.",SB Angel,29 reviews,a year ago,1

TaqueriaLaurita,The food is great. Try the fried queso blanco with spicy guava sauce--it is excellent and the sauce isn't too spicy.,Robert Kyle,2 reviews,7 months ago,5
TaqueriaLaurita,"Objectively, the food is good if you are a foodie and just like good food. If you are Latina and are looking for a bit of home, then you will be disappointed. The original owners are Hispanic but they sold their business to new owners. The new owners are a mixture- one American and one Latino but not from Mexico, which is okay cause like I said the food is still good if you like good food. But if you are looking for a pure Mexican taste then you need to go somewhere else. But if you enjoy good food and nice people, then check them out. My only concern is they have the Mexican flag out in the front of the store that needs repair. In honor of the people of Mexico and the original owners, they will need to get a new flag and respect the culture completely in order for me to move my 3 star rating to a 5 stars. Other than that, if you need a quick lunch, why not stop in for some good tacos.",Avid Book Reader,21 reviews · 1 photo,2 years ago,3
TaqueriaLaurita,If you are reading down through the reviews and see less than 5 stars it's likely that individual was extremely sedated and accidentally left less than 5 by accident.

TaqueriaLaurita,"We decided to try this restaurant for lunch. The guac was not fresh, but the salsa tasted fine. Empanadas were filled with only cheese and were served with a mayonnaise sauce to dip. Chorizo burrito was okay. Food was very bland and underwhelming. Not authentic Mexican.",Dani Welsh,Local Guide · 47 reviews · 16 photos,2 years ago,1
TaqueriaLaurita,"I’m really disappointed about this place. I ordered tacos Al pastor because my friends wanted to eat Mexican food and it was a shame that the meat was not even pork.
I expected to see a Mexican or at least one Latino in the place.

TaqueriaLaurita,The food and drinks were great. It was delicious authentic Mexican cuisine. The staff were really nice and they gave us their personal opinion on what was good.

Worth the trip.,Peter Van Hemert,Local Guide · 69 reviews · 226 photos,7 years ago,5
TaqueriaLaurita,"I love the laid back atmosphere, it's great cute for a quick late-night bite but not for a date. My boyfriend and I went to eat here a few weeks ago and we each got the special. It was affordable and was well proportioned for me although I know he could have eaten more. The people working were nice and the drinks were super yummy! So was the cake! The tacos themselves were good as were the meat pies. The only thing I was put off by were the rice and beans that my boyfriend got...super sketchy, vaguely discolored, odd texture, and flavorless.",Natasha Ahmed,8 reviews,8 years ago,4
TaqueriaLaurita,"Love love loved it! My hang up is they don't deliver. It's nice to have such a selection here and everything was fresh and hot, made to order. Those empanadas though!!!

TaqueriaLaurita,Not impressed.  Overpriced. Meat had been reheated too many times; rubbery.  Tortillas had possibly been steamed instead of heating them on the griddle; result they were mushy and fell apart.  Many (non-critical) health code violations visible.

So good.",Brett Gregory Rudder,Local Guide · 26 reviews · 1 photo,4 years ago,5

Great place for a quick tasty bite or do as I did and have a feast!",sharif s,Local Guide · 24 reviews,5 years ago,5
TaqueriaLaurita,"Drinks are different and very tasty.  Food is pretty good as well. Atmosphere is off.  It's as if you are walking into a food truck.  But, everything else is good about the place AND it's BYOB.  Apparently many people buy beer from Molly Pitcher which is literally across the street and bring it to Taqueria Laurita to have with their meals.  I'm going to keep trying different menu items.  Location is on High Street not too far from the theatre and other main attractions in Carlisle.  Everything from there is in walking distance.",Tom Emond,Local Guide · 22 reviews · 5 photos,4 years ago,4

TaqueriaLaurita,First time here my husband and I were excited to find a Mexican place walking distance from our hotel. My husband order tacos and he said they were good I order mushroom quesadillas and they were so freaking awesome I was pleasantly surprised that they were spicy. Over all the staff is very friendly the only thing my husband did not like was the agua fresca it's was natural so next time we will just order a soda.,celide espriella,11 reviews · 1 photo,6 years ago,3

TaqueriaLaurita,"NOT AUTHENTIC NOT AUTHENTIC. NOT AUTHENTIC. The food was bland, overpriced, nonseasonsed. Seems the burrito doesnt come with the usual vegetables like cilantro and onions. There was no sauce in my burrito. My wife and I are Hispanic reviewers my wife and I do no approve whatsoever. The lady was nice on the phone but in person she couldn't even crack a smile. THE sauce was put in a little baby cup and was called hot BUT WAS NOT HOT WHATSOEVER.  THE pico was just tomatoes mashed with maybe a little cilantro n onions maybe. I would say half a star if I could on the food taste, please get some hispanic people/workers to try the food before selling it. Waste of my money.",4thsun,3 reviews,3 years ago,1
TaqueriaLaurita,"Awesome soft tacos. Had  the mild chorizo tacos and mild mushroom tacos. Beware the mushroom tacos were at the upper end of the heat spectrum that I could handle.

Good flavor, good value, and muy bueno!",michael b,Local Guide · 9 reviews · 5 photos,6 years ago,5
TaqueriaLaurita,In Carlisle for work for the next 5 weeks and in week one I have found a reliably delicious restaurant with great service. Phil makes great recommendations and is really personable. Two days in a row and I think tomorrow will be a third. Yucca Fries are perfectly prepared. Empanadas will make you think about love in a whole new way and the Tacos Al Pastor made me want to be a better man.,William Baumann,2 reviews,4 years ago,5
TaqueriaLaurita,"I got the carne asada burrito with the extra hot sauce. It tasted pretty good, but could have used a bit more heat. The steak they used tasted good except for the couple gristly pieces at the end. At least that shows they're actually using steak. Seeing peas in my burrito threw me off a bit, but didn't harm the flavor. My main gripe is that it's an hour or so later now, and my system seems to want the burrito gone. Profuse sweating and a couple trips to the bathroom might just mean that I'm not used to the fiber power of black beans and need more exercise, but you never know.",Matt Thomsen,Local Guide · 28 reviews · 1 photo,6 years ago,3
TaqueriaLaurita,Gave this place a shot a couple of times and gotta b honest it isnt great.  Portions are ridiculously small. Wouldnt care if the food was worth it. 2.50 is normal for a taco but not for that small an amount. We got a taco truck in harrisburg and i tell you blows these tacos away no gimmicks jus plain and simple tacos where flavor sells it. And 1 taco makes 2 so thats 2.50 spent. Dont waste ur time at this place.,Matt Saez,Local Guide · 148 reviews · 99 photos,5 years ago,1
TaqueriaLaurita,"Delicious tacos in an informal setting. We ordered a selection of tacos to include cow tongue, steak, fish,  and chorizo.  They were served with double corn tortillas, tomatillo sauce,  and limes.  The fried yuca was a disappointment as they were breaded like a cheese stick.  I don't think I've ever eaten it like that and I didn't care for it. It is served with mayo.  With as much corn as it is grown here,  I thought I'd find elotes. They don't have any.  They also sell quesadillas and tostadas. They have aguas frescas. The menu listed desserts like flan and tres leches.
The lady at the counter was not interested in taking our order or helping us make a selection. The entire time she took our order she was leaning over the counter,  elbow on the counter, and chin on hand. She looked bored. She also asked for a tip after she looked like she was going to fall asleep taking our order, really?!
We're coming back for the food not the service but if it keeps being lame,  we may skip the place all together.",Hram Irez,27 reviews · 24 photos,5 years ago,4
TaqueriaLaurita,I think everyone that things this is authentic has never actually eaten a Mexican taco. There was a lot missing it’s okay in flavor but way over priced. I can name 5 other places that I could get 4 real Mexican tacos for less than 2.50. Wanted to try a new place tried it would I do it again? No.,Jasmine Medina,2 reviews · 2 photos,5 years ago,1

TaqueriaLaurita,Tacos were meh! Queso Blanco was white Velveeta. Guac looks like it's from a bag and is very bland. Empinadas are hardly filled and obviously not made with home made dough. Very disappointed. Wouldn't recommend 10\10,Tyler Fox,1 review,3 years ago,1

TaqueriaLaurita,Didn't really like the portion/price ratio. come on 3.00 for a freaking soda I can buy at the store( even though bottled in mexico) for a dollar. that's one hell of a mark-up. the food tasted okay but for the price I'll go to El Rodeo....,barrett blank,Local Guide · 18 reviews,5 years ago,2
TaqueriaLaurita,"Tacos here are pretty subpar, and the price is outrageous. 2.50 a taco?! That's NYC gourmet hipster taco prices, in Carlisle for non-gormet (or even decent) tacos. I've had .75 cent tacos from bodega's that blow these tacos away too. It's just not worth the money. If it were cheaper ($1.50 max) it might be worth it because it's the only Mexican food spot in town. MAYBE...",Tim Young,13 reviews · 1 photo,7 years ago,1
TaqueriaLaurita,"Ordered through Uber eats, ordered a Carne boritto, 4 Caribbean chicken tacos, 2 tamales, boritto was mostly rice, a few beans and a very small amount of beef, tacos were good, would have expected them to be at least a little spicy being Caribbean chicken, and the tamales were tough. Not worth the amount I payed..",Brad Arnold,Local Guide · 20 reviews,5 years ago,3
TaqueriaLaurita,NO!!!  prices are high. Menu is limited. Takes about 30 minutes to get your food that is not even close to good. Someone needs to get thumped on the nose with a rolled up newspaper!!!  Just NO!!!!!!!,Cheeksa Clappin,4 reviews · 1 photo,a year ago,1

I travel for work and while I am away from my home for months at a time I suffer from severe bouts of lackoftacoitis, a potentially lethal condition. Outside of Arizona and Mexico, these are the best tacos I have had the privilege to come across, even in Texas. This place has tacos that would be at home among the best food carts of south Tucson, something you would have to order in Spanish. Their street style take on Sonoran cuisine is so on point and you can tell they use fresh ingredients.",Tyler James Conway,Local Guide · 53 reviews · 2 photos,5 years ago,5

MisenosRistroPub,"This place was a pretty good place before Covid. They claim to have hiked up their prices to maintain the quality and keep staff. However, portions have gotten smaller, and prices have almost doubled for some items. There’s no way a pizza with a single topping should be over $20. If you don’t think that is bad then you’ll be shocked to see that chicken tenders and some fries will cost you over $20. If you are trying to find a place that will not overcharge, you do not choose Misenos. There’s no reason for them to have increased the prices so drastically and all of their food.",Eric Berard,Local Guide · 11 reviews · 3 photos,a year ago,3

They put the lunch meat on backwards so all your topings don't fall off your sandwich....it's the only place I know that does it that way And Once Again (My Opinion Only) We thought it was Awesome!

MisenosRistroPub,So we came in for some food we love this place but not today. They were a lot of tables that needed cleaned off. So we decided to take one of the booths that had dirty plates on it. We sat there for 15 minutes and not one of the staff stop by to clean the table or let us know they would be right with us.  Even  though two of them walk right past us more than once. We understand short staff but we would have stayed if someone would have told us they would be with us shortly or clean the table but nothing. So yes we left not very happy with your restaurant today.,Sandra Ganoe,7 reviews,a year ago,1

MisenosRistroPub,I didn't remember which miseno's I ordered from the last time but this pizza was awful in comparison. It was overcooked. Was not a fan.

MisenosRistroPub,"I ordered a chicken cheesesteak. The bread was really good. However, the chicken meat was crumbled into very tiny pieces. Which created a very odd texture with no flavor. There also was an extreme amount of mayonnaise on the sub. Globs of mayo were falling off. The onions were barely noticeable by the naked eye. Definitely couldn't taste them either. I will try them out again. However, I wouldn't recommend the Chicken Cheesesteak.",Kelsey Schafferman,7 reviews,5 years ago,3

FairgroundsDiner,"It was my first time there, and it sure was not going to be my last as I foresaw quite a few repeat visits.
The food and atmosphere were great, but the best of all was Tracy, our server. She was excellent!",Iin Retno,Local Guide · 165 reviews · 499 photos,3 months ago,5
FairgroundsDiner,"My son had a basketball clinic up the street and wanted breakfast when we were finished.   The reviews for Fairgrounds Diner looked pretty good,  so we decided to try it.   We stopped in at 10am on Sunday and the diner was less than half full.   We were seated pretty quick,  but sat about 10 minutes before our drink order was taken.   Took about 10 minutes to get coffee and a soda.   We ordered our food but waited at least 30 minutes for the food to come.   My son had an omelet, and I had country fried steak with eggs over medium.  The country fried steak was pretty good with the gravy, but by eggs were not even done over easy.   I was able to get my coffee cup refilled once,  but that was it.  I sat there for almost 30 minutes trying to get a box and the check.  I ended up giving up on both and going to register and standing until I could get my check.   They waitress was nice and took $3 off the check,  but we won't be back.",Jason S,Local Guide · 232 reviews · 250 photos,6 months ago,3
FairgroundsDiner,"In town for business and it was late and we were tired and hungry.   This is an unassuming place that really turned out to be a pleasant surprise.   I ordered the Greek salad and it had a delicious grape leaf wrapped meat filled roll in it.  It was so good! The other entree ordered was a ham and cheese panini sandwich with fries, which I tasted. Both were very good! This is reasonably priced.  We came near closing time and the waitress was as friendly as if it were the beginning of her shift. Definitely will be back if I'm in the area.",Diane Zuber,Local Guide · 265 reviews · 502 photos,a year ago,5
FairgroundsDiner,"If I could give this negative stars for management and service, I would. I have lived in Carlisle for over 10 years and gotten food here multiple times. Today, I ordered $70 worth of breakfast on their website online order section (which I’ve done before) at 10am. It said it would be ready by 11am. I was fine with that because of the amount of food. I got a text confirmation and email, immediately after placing order. At 11 my husband went in and 2 ladies told him there’s no order. I called the number on the text confirmation to see if it was a scam and it went to the owner! He said “they’ll make now and it’ll be 10 mins”. I got off the phone and talked to my husband who wasn’t happy we are now waiting longer. I called owner back and he proceeded to tell me that I should be happy he was even open and to watch how I spoke to him when I was insisting for some compensation back. I wasn’t swearing or being disrespectful. He offered my husband who was waiting a drink!! A drink out of $70 and 1.5 hours of waiting for food. He is incredibly rude, a liar, and I won’t be back. He tried telling me he only got my order when I called him.. lies! Ladies working said this isn’t uncommon. What a liar who can’t hold his own and do the right thing for his customers.",Meagan H,8 reviews · 1 photo,3 months ago,1

FairgroundsDiner,We have eaten here many times. Usually with very good service and food. The atmosphere is usually 5 stars. I got the shrimp platter special that was 19.99. It came with a sm salad and 1 side. I got my salad and side. The platter had 6 shrimp and a bunch of cut-up lettuce on it. Was charged extra for my side because it was the sweet potato fries that weren't mentioned. The waitress only did half her job.  It didn't help my elderly mom had to deal with kids beating on the booth she sat on. I'm not sure why. Most of the staff we saw was not the staff we usually see on a Sunday.  I  will question how much is in a special platter next time. Mom got the stuffed haddock and got a large portion. She said it was very good. We will go back but will be more careful what I order.,Samantha Martin,41 reviews · 9 photos,5 months ago,4
FairgroundsDiner,I went to Fairground Dinner with my family. I ordered the fish sandwich.  The fish was barely warm.  I  took 1 bite and spit it right out.  I looked into the fish and the fish was dried out and unrecognizable.  I refused to pay for my meal.  Me and my family will never eat at that restaurant again.

Not sure if it's broken or they just don't have it. They did have a small fan at our booth. My son had chicken fingers and fries, so little chance of messing that up. I had chicken ranch wrap. It was ok, nothing to rave about. Tasted like I could make it at home. It did come very quickly and the fries were tasty. Not sure I'll be back.

FairgroundsDiner,"It was fine but I wouldn’t come here regularly.
Our server was fantastic- coming from this industry- she gets it. If I rated it purely based on service from her and nothing else prob a 5. She ever gave us a to go coffee, which he planned on sitting there to drink but was nice to be on our way and the coffee was far better than the coffee from our hotel so thanks so much.

But the milkshake was just milk, it wasn’t good and a big boo for $5.
Also was charged for onions when asked for them in the “home fries” but they were more like mashed potato’s and a ton of maybe butter idk. But no onions. 😑

The new girl (she told us it was her first day) was very nice.

The other server- honey when the it is orange it’s decaf, nice you offered a refill but as a diner coffee etiquette is a first step, and the hard eye roll for a refill was annoying. And she’s was kinda snotty, not at towards me but I saw the lady you were serving wasn’t happy either. And don’t talk smack about customers (regular because you had a Nick name for them) in front of anyone else. That’s not a good look, I’ve ripped servers for less both working with them and while a patron.

We are learn from experiences. And no way to get better if no one tells you.",Chelsee beck,Local Guide · 76 reviews · 110 photos,11 months ago,4
FairgroundsDiner,"The waitress seemed like she was strung out.   The home fries were sour (I think the butterlike substance they fry them in had gone off).  The toast was stale and they used canned mushrooms in the alpine omelette.   They had church on the TV, which is a turn off for me.   When we left it felt like we were being admonished for leaving too quick.   STAY AWAY!",Bill Heasley,Local Guide · 78 reviews · 14 photos,6 months ago,1

FairgroundsDiner,"It has a menu similar to other diners but there are some good differences. I usually get a chicken breast sandwich, or grilled 🧀 chicken. They cook it very well with just enough spices to taste good. When they have the Italian meatloaf in special, that is another good choice. I have not had an issue with the service or food that has kept me away.  I do not expect perfection and hate to waste food. If I can wait till the end to show the problem then I do. I have not found any diner that I could not find a fault but most are minor and I can just ignore them. Please do not fault the waitress/waiter for the fault and not tip. They are probably paid less than you think.",David Myers,Local Guide · 9 reviews,2 years ago,5
FairgroundsDiner,Service was terrible. Our waitress checked on us one time. She also stood behind the counter and starred at us the whole time we were eating. The food was absolutely terrible.

FairgroundsDiner,"Stopped in for a Sunday lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  The wait staff was quick and efficient, but still friendly.  The food came out very quickly, and the quality and flavor were very good.  The pricing was fair for the quantity of food received.  The diner was clean and well kept.  I can honestly say that I don't know how the experience could have been better.",I Smith,Local Guide · 74 reviews · 5 photos,6 years ago,5

FairgroundsDiner,Wonderful people! Love the food! We order there alot. Being a MD girl i loved the fries and gravy instead of cheese! Definitely will keep returning there!,Tracy Cook,Local Guide · 89 reviews · 13 photos,9 months ago,5
FairgroundsDiner,"Service was great, seated immediately. Breakfast was just so-so. I was so looking forward to chicken fried steak and eggs of which was a breakfast special for the day at $12.95. The gravy was bland and tasted like uncooked flour, rather ""pasty"". The portion was fairly large. Our waitress was very nice and attentive.
I've heard from several people that this place is the best in Carlisle, I can't agree with that statement.",Sharon Edinger,5 reviews,4 years ago,2
FairgroundsDiner,One of the better dinners in Carlisle. Food is always consistent. I will say it's not the best but it's definitely the most reliable which may arguably make it better.,Jeremy Raulerson,Local Guide · 40 reviews · 135 photos,a year ago,4
FairgroundsDiner,I have eaten here before and lately they have gone down hill. I ordered breaded flounder and so did my mom and they both came out way over cooked. They were harder then a rock. The service wasn’t bad but wait times were large since it appeared only two waitresses were working. In the end I know it’s hit or miss with how the quality will be but I still thought I should share this experience.,Trav Sheaffer,6 reviews · 2 photos,5 years ago,2
FairgroundsDiner,Wife was extremely happy with wedding soup and stuffed cabbage. I had a simple burger but it was very good. Server was very friendly. Took a while to get our check but that was no big thing.,Matt Berrier,81 reviews · 5 photos,2 years ago,5
FairgroundsDiner,"Ordered eggs with cheese. Server asked what cheese! American! Comes out no cheese.  Her "" you wanted cheese"" brings it back with cold cheese slapped on top!  my daughter ordered a wrap with sour cream. Server, ""in it or on the side"". ""In it"" comes on the side! My other daughter asked for ranch FOUR times. Finally server walked by the table and threw it! Yes she threw it to the table! Horrible service! Guessing restaurants are hiring anyone these days to fill the spots but my hard earned money will be spent where I can get what I ask for. Owner was very kind and offered to fix everything. But service was so bad I highly doubt we will be back any time soon
Edited to add! I'm so glad I went and gave them another chance. That little girl they have in there now is amazing and so friendly! Thank you for hiring her",Bonnie,Local Guide · 73 reviews · 12 photos,2 years ago,5

She supplied all that was ordered without any errors.",Vincent Ringer,Local Guide · 241 reviews · 261 photos,3 years ago,5
FairgroundsDiner,I was pleasantly surprised by Fairgrounds Diner. I attended a meeting there and had no idea what to order. I asked for soup suggestions and got the bowl of pepper pot. I didn't even know what that was. She explained and it was so good I finished the whole bowl. I've had surgery and finishing my food doesn't usually happen. It was light yet hardy and satisfying. I'll go there again and take my husband. They were accepting and so nice. The rest of my party have been there so often they knew the menu! And the servers knew them! Ok I've been missing out!,Meredith Jenkins,Local Guide · 42 reviews · 50 photos,4 years ago,5

FairgroundsDiner,"The food, especially breakfast, is amazing. The staff on the other hand... No. We're local and used to go regularly but the incompetent staff has made it so we will not return. Again, the food is amazing. But you shouldn't have to wait for your food to be corrected or have to take your food back every time you get take out.",Tyler Auman,11 reviews,2 years ago,3
FairgroundsDiner,"Wide variety of menu items. The service was disappointing and slow.  This place was not very busy and still kept moving slowly.  Sadly, it is not nearly as popular as it used to be. The food was okay at best and priced high. I used to recommend this place but I cannot anymore.  Sad...",Brandon Deitch,Local Guide · 471 reviews · 205 photos,a year ago,3
FairgroundsDiner,"Even for diner food, this place left A LOT to be desired. I suspect they’re only turning a profit because of their proximity to the Fairgrounds. If you’re in the area for a car show and you’re willing to travel a mile or more, go somewhere else.
I ordered the Mexican wrap. The chicken had the texture of and tasted like it was Hormel brand CANNED chicken and the “hot peppers” were pickled. My husband had the Mushroom Swiss burger and it tasted old. The meat was sweet as if it had gone bad and the slimy mushrooms came out of a can. It was unsettling so he didn’t finish it. As far as I could tell, my son’s Reuben was ok; it was just tiny.
I’m giving them 2 stars because the service was GREAT but the food was awful.",Brandi El Guemra,11 reviews,4 years ago,2

FairgroundsDiner,"Waitress sucked, everybodys cup was empty and had to ask for refills. Country fried steak tasted like flower. Grilled chicken weighed less than my junk. Bun was crunchy and hard. Fries were good, but she forgot to bring them out so I was full by the time I got them. Their coke is cut with something that gave me diarrhea.",Mike Lieberman,9 reviews,5 years ago,1
FairgroundsDiner,"Had lunch here on 6/3/22. One friend got sick from the chicken salad sandwhich, my Rueben had a slice of leather on it instead of corned beef, and another guy had a patty melt., which was, "" not good"". When I mentioned the poor quality of the corned beef to our waitress, she replied, ""tough, huh?"" Never, ever, again will we/I go there. Disgusting...",James Piatak,22 reviews,a year ago,1

FairgroundsDiner,I used to LOVE this place but the last several times we've went the food was horrible. I kept trying hoping it was just an off day. Have been for breakfast lunch and dinner.

FairgroundsDiner,"Our water glasses were dirty, menus were dirty, silverware was sticky. Service was super slow, and half the time we felt like our waitress forgot about us. Food was super below average, I had the smoked sausage omlette and it was certainly nothing special, toast was burnt. My fiancé had the French toast, it was under cooked and the cherries had obviously been microwaved. Don’t think we will be back which is a shame because this place is so close to home.",Matt Crimmins,1 review · 2 photos,4 years ago,2
FairgroundsDiner,"using rags from buckets is not cleaning a table
smoked sausage not able to eat... no where does it say HOT nor did the server even have a clue when I mentioned it
asked for scrambled eggs got over easy... at 1245 pm
so I do not expect a breakfast rush excuse
finally the one thing that told me how my experience would go, the table sat next to us seated after us although server seen us first they got service & there drinks before we were acknowledged",Nicole Wilson,17 reviews · 5 photos,2 years ago,1

FairgroundsDiner,Place was good in presentation and the waitress was courteous. The fries were very good and that helped the rating. The downside was the warm bland fairgrounds wrap. Unfortunately not very good but will try something else later.,Neal Cox,12 reviews · 13 photos,5 years ago,3
FairgroundsDiner,Food was good and priced accordingly. The staff was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere was average. I suggest this restaurant for a quick bite or for brunch/light lunch.

FairgroundsDiner,"Updated response below:

Tried for first time tonight. Got the french onion soup and ruben panini plate. It was great, best tasting food since I've been in PA

EDIT:
Ate here again today and it was the complete opposite, got the ruben panini plate again expecting the same good experience but that was not the case. The sandwich was not crispy, it was soggy probably from the massive amount of sauerkraut, it literally had one tiny sliver of a piece of meat and 3 times the sauerkraut it should have. I'm really disappointed and due to the inconsistency in quality, I won't be eating here again.",Noey Wessinger,16 reviews · 8 photos,3 years ago,2

FairgroundsDiner,"Breakfast is what we end up at this diner for. They are reasonably priced and normally we can walk in and be seated right away. They are busy though so it tends to be a noisy diner with children scurrying around. Our last visit some unlucky soul had just flung his camaro through a field or yard. They must've had breakfast while they were waiting for someone to come pick them up as their car had 2 flat tires on one side, some damge and grass along the sides of the car. We parked next to them and I couldn't help but notice the car and the driver's look as he returned to the car from the front door of the diner.

McDonalds,"I recently visited your establishment primarily for the playhouse, which my family enjoys. However, I felt compelled to share my experience regarding the service and food during our recent visit.

Upon ordering two happy meals and two main menu items for dine-in through the kiosk, we received number 34. After a 20-minute wait in the playhouse dining area, confusion arose when an employee called out number 38 instead. Despite our insistence that our number was 34, it took verifying at the counter to confirm the discrepancy.

The lukewarm state of our food, likely due to the extended wait, and the mix-up with our drink order were further disappointments. What puzzled me most was witnessing another family, arriving after us, have their food promptly delivered to their table in the playhouse. This inconsistency in service left me perplexed and frustrated.

While I understand the challenges of handling a high volume of customers, the discrepancies in our experience point towards issues with leadership consistency and accountability. I appreciate the hard work of your team but believe there is room for improvement in ensuring a smoother and more reliable dining experience.

I offer this feedback as my personal perspective and hope it serves as constructive input for the betterment of your restaurant. Thank you for your attention to these matters, and I trust that steps will be taken to enhance the overall customer experience.",Luis Ortiz,Local Guide · 31 reviews · 28 photos,4 months ago,1
McDonalds,"Within the last couple of years they remodeled and put in a fantastic kids area.  Not only does it have a play place but it has interactive games for the kids to play with too.  My kids love coming here and being able to play while they wait for food.

The food is typical McDonald's but made well, and the staff is always friendly and helpful.",Andrew Spurgeon,Local Guide · 18 reviews · 2 photos,4 months ago,5
McDonalds,"11-15-23: My children have C's in school, have no job, and pay no bills, so why in the Hell do they even have a vote on where we go out to eat? They surround me.. circling like vultures they do... yapping and squawking ""Please father dearest, please take us to McDonalds"". After much protest my crys of sanity and attempts to lure them across the street to Arby's was met with too much resistance for one man to bare...so McDonald's it was.

I ordered the new chicken deluxe meal and they gave me HALF a chicken patty. This is some serious Build Back Betterest  sandwich if I've ever seen one. Look at that Old Yeller sitting waiting to taken out to pasture.  $10 sandwich for a chicken nugget/bread & condiment sandwich?

Anyway, the good news is that after spending $50 McDonald's forgot every single sauces that the kids specifically asked for. Serves those freeloading kids right making bad decisions in life. As for the crew and the rest of the failing McDonald's franchise...God Speed!",Jason Simmons,Local Guide · 151 reviews · 174 photos,5 months ago,2
McDonalds,"I recently visited this establishment and while I was there my mother ordered an iced coffee, but she has very sensitive teeth, so she does not like ice and ordered it without ice. Here is where the problem began, when she got her drink she was surprised because it was a half full of coffee, and when she asked if they could fill it more they refused. Another experience I’ve had is when I ordered a salad, it looked fine until I noticed a dead fly in it. The only good thing about this place is the one worker at the window.",Malachi Jones,1 review,a month ago,1

McDonalds,"The only McDonald's I've been to where ordering on the app seemed to complicate things. There was nothing wrong with the food, but definitely something wrong with how long I had to wait for a 10 piece nugget meal.

McDonalds,I would not even give this McDonalds any stars if it were up to me. Our food was dry and absolutely disgusting. We bought food for our whole family and below I posted only 3 of our sandwiches before I was even going to post. From the time we were ordering to the time we got our food we encountered rude employees. A girl with two lip piercings and long hair was absolutely rude even handing us our food. I rarely make comments about fast food but this was just sad! Dont waste your time getting fast food at this location I would  head elsewhere.,Gabby Henry,9 reviews · 10 photos,4 years ago,1

McDonalds,"One of the better McDonald's around. The food was out fast and it was very good. They did miss a few items clearly on our order even though it wasn't crowded at all. The play area was also closed for cleaning which I was pretty bummed about because it looked like a really interesting dining area with the touchscreen tables and colorful lights. Regardless, I would recommend this McDonald's over other fast food places around.",Sentient Soup,Local Guide · 128 reviews · 484 photos,4 years ago,4

McDonalds,I ordered Sausage mcMuffins and coffee with cream INSIDE the coffee and alot of sugar on the side. My mcMuffins came  out good but my coffee had no creamer and the lady did not want to add my creamer because it was to much of an inconvenience to add it because she  had already made the coffee before hand. She had a horrible attitude.  I understand perfectly  People have their days but this was unacceptable behavior when your job is dealing with people.  If she can't deal with people then she should go to the back flipping burgers then. One more thing the coffee tasted horrible and it had coffee grains in it. I will never go back there again.,Lidania Medina,6 reviews · 5 photos,11 months ago,2

McDonalds,"My daughter and I ordered the big breakfast with hotcakes, a med coke and a large mocha frappe. We will never come back to this McDonald’s. The eggs were slimy ( not done) there was not 1 but 2 pieces of hair in my food. One in the eggs and one in between the pancakes… I never went up so say anything to them due to the fact another customer went up to complain about her sandwich and the manager kept whispering and giving her dirty looks. So I figured what was the point. We threw our food away washed our hands and left.

McDonalds,It's McDonald's so nothing to get worked up about. Most of the time when you get the food it's barely warm if that. They constantly run out of things and wait until you ask them to let you know about it. Staff will look at each other when you go to place an order as though nobody wants to help. Numerous occasions it took placing a self-service kiosk order because multiple staff looked my way and completely ignored that I was waiting to place an order. The only benefit to this particular location is their playroom which they do keep incredibly clean.,Tom Murry,Local Guide · 139 reviews · 15 photos,a year ago,3

McDonalds,"It's a dysfunctional place. I placed a dine-in order at the kiosk at 10:08 Sunday morning according to the slip, and it took 25 minutes for them to get my order to me. It didn't look like they were short-handed, there were many very busy people doing very busy things, cars happily streamed through the drive-thru continuously.

Nothing on the McD's breakfast menu takes that long to get ready. Nothing. Every ten minutes or so I got someone's attention to remind them that I'd placed an order, and that didn't help. No explanations were given that made any sense.

Once I finally got my food I had to reach over the counter and grab my own salt and pepper since everyone was so busy with ... things.

The food was okay, I guess.",Christopher Otto,Local Guide · 51 reviews · 26 photos,a year ago,1

McDonalds,"The worst experience I've ever had at a mcdonalds firstly all of the food is over priced, $10 for a small breakfast sandwich mean with a hash brown and a tiny OJ. Secondly the service was horrible. 2 kids at the front counter who had no idea what was going on and a manager constantly making the wrong orders. Our food was brought out and was missing have the stuff. I told the girl who brought it out and she didn't understand even while showing the reciept, the manager had to come out. She annoyingly put theboj on the table and said nothing. I had to go back up and ask about the cookies I ordered. The kids had to ask the manager again who told them ""just tell them they are being made"" and they gave a fake answer of they're being made. I waited 30 minutes until I went back up and asked them to refund then because I've been waiting 30 minutes and had been there for over an hour. The manager had to come over and was very rude when I asked if she needed the reciept. I got my money and left. In the over an hour I was there I witnessed no less than 10-15 people come back in saying they got the wrong item or they were missing items. The manager was the one making the orders and closing them with items missing. Ruined my McDonald's experience. I can get significantly better food elsewhere like Chili fil a for cheaper and and actually feel like their employees care.",Kyle Zindell,Local Guide · 16 reviews · 1 photo,a year ago,1

McDonalds,"The had some confusion at the drive thru  with our drinks..we ordered the new seasonal  Iced Pumpkin coffees. I decided to check my receipt once we got home and was confused, because it it looked as if I had been over charged. I called in and and asked for a manager to see if they could explain why my receipt was what I perceived was wrong.  When I asked who I was speaking to, this manager immediately got defensive and REFUSED to identify herself. I was polite the entire time, never once raised my voice, I just wanted clarity on why/how this was happened.  Even the kids in the drive thru were confused when we came through about our order. She told me just to come in and get a refund for the upcharge on the drink and the chocolate milk for the happy meal.
*When I stopped in the next day, I spoke to another manager, who TOOK THE TIME to explain what happened and WHY THEIR SYSTEM does what it does AND I ACTUALLY WAS NOT OVER CHARGED.

McDonalds,"This is such a great McDonald’s I’m almost grateful for their wonderful PlayPlace they have. McDonalds play places are extremely rare these days, and I’m glad that me and my family go there every Christmas vacation to Pennsylvania almost every single year. The play place area also plays good kid-friendly music too, which is also very cool! And the area also has good activities other than the slides, like the touch screens and stuff.",Dylan Rodgers,Local Guide · 90 reviews · 36 photos,a year ago,5
McDonalds,"Staff at this particular location seem corporately unconcerned with order accuracy, or indeed with any aspects of the customer experience. Even picking up a mobile order for just coffee, it's not unusual to stand in line for 10 minutes or more, and still receive the wrong product on the first attempt. Today was the third strike for this location in my book.",David Glasgow,Local Guide · 23 reviews · 6 photos,2 years ago,2
McDonalds,"Went there for breakfast, and the two girls that rang me out & gave me my food were absolute sweethearts.

McDonalds,Gentleman taking orders and collecting cash was very nice.

McDonalds,The person take orders on night shift was very disrespectful. The speaker was barely working so you couldn't here them.  Once I got up to the window and went to hand the girl that was taking the cash and everything for my order she was disrespectful when I was trying to give her my code for my rewards on McDonald's it's on McDonald's and told me I should have gave it up at the speaker when The app says that you are supposed to show it to the cashier and I was even told by an employee of McDonald's that they can't take the code over the speaker the day you have to physically see it and scan it at the same time period period it also does not help that she was using profound language while talking to other coworkers and the window was wide open to where other people could hear her. I also got my food cold the fries were stale still and I don't think it was necessary for necessary for her to use profound language while having  A customer sit at the window waiting for their food,Kristalyn Licina,3 reviews,a year ago,2

McDonalds,I’m a DoorDash delivery driver. I went to this restaurant to get the order and i had to wait for 25 minutes to get it.

McDonalds,"Boyfriend and I stopped for iced coffees around 6:30 pm.Both of us got Large Carmel iced coffees with cream and sugar. I got extra Carmel and he got espresso and whipped cream.(2.40 extra) It was slow, only a couple cars in the drive they and no one else inside. There was also Game cigars sitting on the part where they put the food…gross. 10 minutes went by…still no drinks. In the meantime this guy comes in and orders a bunch of food and a blended drink. Well he got his stuff before we even got our drinks. At this point it’s been 15 minutes so I asked the one lady. She said they’ll make it when they’re not busy with drive thru. (Rude) Finally some girl makes my drink and then minutes later tells my boyfriend they have no espresso…ok cool. We got a refund for it but the manager seemed annoyed. When he finally got his drink we had been there over 20 minutes for iced coffees. They didn’t even put whipped cream on it which he paid extra for…Both coffees tasted the same and very watered down.Very rude staff…no one in the back was in uniform they all had hoodies or non -uniform T-shirts on.",Vanessa Casterline,14 reviews · 2 photos,a year ago,1

McDonalds,"At this McD's you are likely to encounter a long wait at the Mc-drive-thru and a decent chance of getting parked (notice all of the park & Mc-wait spaces). *Pay attention when driving in this area* McD Mc-minions in yellow safety vests randomly dart around the parking area.
It's fast food. Same now as it was when you were a kid. Any meal, at any time, can make your day or, cause a tribal war in your Mc-minivan while you're taking the fam cross country.
*Be prepared.
*Check your bag before you pull away!
*If you have to get back on I-81 you want to stay left while leaving. There are a lot of accidents in this area. Be alert.

Sat at register for 5 minutes with no one acknowledging our existence. Had to order from kiosk (Which I hate. Take notice McDonald's)  Manager on her phone texting.

I usually have a couple of extra requests - light ice, heavy on the cream, etc.  They get it right and with kindness in their customer service.  The food is hot and tasty.  Love the sugar free iced coffee!  When I'm on 81, I pass other exits to go to this McDonald's specifically.  It's a quick stop off the exit.  The line, when there is one, goes quickly and I'm soon back on the road.  Inside is clean and well maintained.",Helene,Local Guide · 118 reviews · 42 photos,6 years ago,5

McDonalds,"The service at this location is typically very good and is staffed with friendly faces. I'd have to place the accuracy at around 90% in terms of receiving your meal exactly the way you ordered and initially confirmed it at the drive thru ordering post. Due to the location of this storefront, the peak times around breakfast lunch and dinner are extremely busy (which is when I've noticed orders aren't fulfilled correctly most of the time). Somehow this location handles the rush and for that I give them total props. The hours posted online do NOT match the actual hours this location is actually open for business, which I've already published an hours of operation revision through Google. Hopefully that will be fixed soon.",Jared Schipper,Local Guide · 82 reviews · 958 photos,6 years ago,4
McDonalds,"At the time there were a minimum of 10 vehicles at the drive thru and 3 waiting for meal pick ups. Also there was only 5 workers to complete orders to which 1 drive thru ordered 30 cheeseburgers plus other things. Everyone worked together without any comments of stress or anger. Recognizing the tasks, I didn't mind waiting a few more minutes. My burgers were made to order, the manager also gave me a large fries to compensate for the 5 min wait. The establishment was very clean. The order taker still greeted and ended with a smile. I'm not big on fast food but I am big on customer service, dedication to work despite the wage.

I saw a ton of older folks who were utterly baffled though. Staff was there to help them, I got what I ordered delivered to my table, and I left happy. It was sort of chaotic, but any new transition is. Overall, it was kind of cool. Definitely a reminder that we live in the future. If you like the traditional experience, then use the drive-thru.

McDonalds,"I was very disappointed with my visit at this McDonald's today. I ordered a double cheeseburger 🍔 to go but decided to eat there. The sandwich was barely lukewarm. I was given another which was colder than the first. I couldn't believe it. 😲 Reported this to a woman I assumed was the manager. She seemed a little annoyed 😖 but ordered me another sandwich ""fresh from the grill"", then turned & handed it to me without a word & walked away.  I was gracious both times & thanked her but she did not respond in kind. To make matters worse, the ""fresh from the grill"" sandwich was not. It may have been taken off the grill but definitely was not fresh,😜 but at least it was warmer. I think the worst part was the attitude of the ""manager"". She made ""me"" feel like I was ruining ""her"" day.  Her job was to apologize for ""my"" inconvenience & to do that with a smile on her face. She did neither!  On the otherhand, the young lady who originally waited on me was kind & very helpful. I don't plan on going back to this McDonald's anytime soon,  unless they want to make it worth my while. I doubt that's going to happen. 👎👎",Leilani Brandt,5 reviews · 1 photo,6 years ago,2

McDonalds,"I don't write negative review for any restaurant, but today I am forced to write this review by the quality of food and attitude of staff in the drive-thru window. I ordered one large french fry, one medium vanilla milk shake, and Ice-tea for myself. First of all this lady gave me pre-filled ice-tea that was sitting in the window and I asked for fresh from the dispenser then she again grabbed another pre-filled ice tea that was there and top it with ice. I took that tea and tasted it but it was very warm even after putting ice in it. Similarly the vanilla shake was not as cold and french fry was soggy and my girlfriend got sick after eating it. Since it was next to UPMC hospital, I thought lots of people visiting the hospital would go there to grab food like I did and I don't want them to be disappointed by the food as well as I don't want them to get sick.

It was clean & when we go to Carlisle we will go to this McDonald's.",Karena Kell,"Local Guide · 266 reviews · 1,477 photos",5 years ago,5
McDonalds,Fast friendly people. The manager was very patient while a newer guy was on register. I'd go back,Daniel Swafford,52 reviews · 10 photos,a year ago,5
McDonalds,If I could give this place 0 stars I would. This McDonald's used to be my better choice than the one on high st.. But lately every time I come through drive through the service is disgustingly rude and the food is either cold or has a black paper like susbstance on my meats. I ask for a simple chicken nugget meal about 1 week ago and they only gave me 5 nuggets with cold fries. I called and whoever answered the phone was extremely rude and didn't want to hear the issue.  You need to fix these issues. Corporate will be hearing from me.,Molly Amber,Local Guide · 39 reviews · 12 photos,7 years ago,1

McDonalds,"McDonalds on High street is HORRIBLE!  The orders are 85% of the time wrong. You literally have to expect to be sitting in the drive thru for about 30 mins, no matter your order size. The employees are usually young rude punks that don't seem to understand even the basics of common courtesy let alone customer service. Also,  no matter how understanding and nice you are about bringing your jacked up order to their attention, they still somehow find a way to make you feel like you're burdening them for asking for the correct food that you paid for with your hard earned money. Its just ridiculous.  I go out of my way to go to the next closest location because its THAT BAD.",KYRA Woods,Local Guide · 44 reviews · 92 photos,5 years ago,1
McDonalds,"Wow.  Wow!!!  Just had the absolute worst mushroom Swiss burger of all time from any chain.  Burger was very salty and lukewarm; the onion pieces were cold; the bun felt like it sat out all night; same for the Swiss cheese; and the mushrooms were lukewarm.  The only great part was the Coke!  No I realize it was lunchtime, but seriously?  Isn't someone checking how long food sits from the time it's made?  It'll be awhile before I stop there for food again.",Liz Myers,56 reviews,5 years ago,1

McDonalds,"Don't.  This particular McDonalds has really gone downhill.  Confusing service inside with their kiosks, instead of friendly service at the counter.  Poor drive-through service.  Just today I ordered a simple Big Mac meal (#1).  I had to wait 5 min at the pickup window, then 5 more minutes at the wait lane.  My ""Big"" Mac looked the size of a dollar burger ... dried out, messy (made in haste), plain taste.  No salt on the fries, no napkin.  I am done with this place.",Eric Melder,24 reviews,5 years ago,1

McDonalds,Tried to get some ketchup waited at the counter withiut a line for 7 minutes while two employees stood at a trash can talking. Two others just filled orders from kiosk and drive through without even acknowledging me. Eventually  I interrupted someone and asked for it. She said it's back here behind the counter like I was supposed to get it myself. The sweet tea was empty. Was told they had to brew more but if I went out to the drive through I could have some. Every time I go here I regret it. Only go back so kids can play on playland.,Michael Cramer,Local Guide · 13 reviews · 7 photos,5 years ago,2

Not sure why you dont check them before you serve them, I called and was told drive back for fresh ones... thank you but how easy is that when you run out on a break!?!  Hope they start letting people go and put in the self-serve machines so the people there actually want to be there and appreciate their job!

I'm mad, I was hungry and I'm busy so when I stop in for something quick I expect it to be right.  You have that huge LED display and all that tech but canr cook or keep fries fresh! Smh",Scott Mattern,Local Guide · 53 reviews · 321 photos,5 years ago,1
McDonalds,They can't ever seem to get the iced mochas right. Either they use skim milk when I specifically asked for whole milk or they make it caramel when I said mocha or they forget to put whipped cream on it. If a customer goes back in and has to wait all over again because they messed it up it's taking that customer more of their valuable time. The customer should be refunded the cost and McDonald's should make it again the right way for no cost. Or at least half off. Why am I paying full price and waiting twice as long while making two trips to the counter or drive thru? That's expensive and inconvenient for the customer,C. Reisinger,Local Guide · 36 reviews · 176 photos,4 years ago,1
McDonalds,$1.79 U.S dollars for 1 breakfast hashbrown? When you do the exchange that's about $2.00 Canadian!! No matter what false truths you've been fed food is not cheaper in the States lol.

McDonalds,"It's exactly what you would expect out of a McDonalds, half decent food, little to no throw up on any of the floors in the dining area (AND BATHROOMS) Speaking of the not so portable John, the bathrooms were very well maintained, despite what some other reviews may say, one of the cleaner locations I've been to. The other reviews who say this place isn't as nice as it is should be deleted. Hey Google, how do I delete someone else's review?

Google isn't helping me.

Anyway, this restaurant is fairly well maintained and clean, no rats on the floor, just kids, plenty of children. I saw a kid crawling on the floor saying ""I'M A TAR-RIB-DACTLE"" The poor kid obviously had been failed by the education system. I call him Kid but he was probably 12 or 13. To be honest he was the most gross thing in the whole place, I think he found a few fries in the trash can because shortly after he spiderman crawled under a table to eat a few while his parents were ordering. When the kid caught me staring at him he hissed at me and crawled into the other room with the ball pit. That child was probably possessed.

Anyway, good service, good food, clean building, possessed kid 4/5",Tyler Nate,6 reviews,5 years ago,4

McDonalds,The play place had alot of money put into it. Kids loved the play place and I was highly impressed. The staff on the other hand really could use some training. I customized my sandwhich and it was made incorrectly. When i brought it to the counter they wanted to argue about it. Then the cashier individual decided that they were going to give me attitude and walk to the line and throw my sandwich at the person and still get it wrong. The line person attempted to make it right but meanwhile the manager stood in the back and watched this occur. Really poor management. Definetly not going back here and id suggest the same to anyone that ask. For more details i had the chesse abd butter removed from the sandwhich. Picture below of receipt. I was given a sandwich with egg and one peice of bacon on it.,Jeremy Raulerson,Local Guide · 40 reviews · 135 photos,5 years ago,2
McDonalds,"I know it’s the pandemic. Lots of the staff is calling in sick. BUT, it’s not a reason to mix up so many orders. We asked for a large ice coffee with Caramel. What do we get? No caramel in the coffee. Then we ask for pumpkin pies (4) they answer we only have two.. and we don’t have anymore apple either...  Ask for Mcflurry.. half filled.. and way too liquid..

McDonalds,"First time visiting this McDonald's since the remodeling.  Not sure I'm a fan of the kiosk thing.  The double quarter pounder sandwich looked rather small (yes...I know, it's pre-cooked weight). My buttermilk chicken sandwich in the brioche bun was very good.

They no longer have condiments such as salt, pepper, ketchup available.  We had to ask at the counter.

I mention the main setting only because it's a preferred stop when I'm travelling, but the restaurant in question here is a bit slow and somewhat disorganized. If you need a quick bite or something a little more substantial than junk food (the term would be relative in this case!) it's pretty much fine, but nothing to write home about. If you don't mind making another quick stop, there are a few other well known fast food chains (e.g. Dunkin Donuts, BK, Wendy's, etc.)within sight as well.",J Crowfoot,Local Guide · 24 reviews · 3 photos,5 years ago,3

Projections everywhere showing underwater sealife, music from multiple Disney movies, TV screen showing other animated films, and 3 computers with games. Very cool idea but a little overwhelming. The new kiosks could create a major problem for customers and employees. I like the kiosk for complete customization but I could see why others would like to talk to a person. Lastly, the employees should be concerned because they could be out of a job or more people may just order drive thru because they do not want the hassle of the kiosk.",Brandon Deitch,Local Guide · 471 reviews · 205 photos,5 years ago,4

MisenoIIPizzeriaItalian,"Amazing!!! Awesome!!! Super!!! You can add as many adjectives as you can. We have been there twice and had different dishes on those occasions. Both the times the food surpassed our expectation.

It is not a fancy place, it is just like an ordinary shop. But what’s served on the table are extra ordinary. Last day we ordered seafood bambino and chicken steak hoagie. Both were super delicious. I can’t say more on how delicious these food were. The right amount of cheese and the right amount of toppings such as shrimp, crab meat and mussels were on the pizza.

And the hoagie was full of chicken and the perfect amount of mayo inside of it. I will definitely recommend my friends to go there and try their food.

Service and atmosphere were also very very good.",Tomal Das,Local Guide · 19 reviews · 51 photos,8 months ago,5

It's the best I've ever had! And that's the expert talking. The crust was perfection. The sauce was the tastiest. The cheese was incredibly fresh and...well, cheesy. Service is great! The prices were amazingly reasonable. And it had that wonderful neighborhood pizzeria quality. Everyone seemed to know each other. Stop in sometime...and may I suggest you try their Grandma Pizza.

MisenoIIPizzeriaItalian,"We had them deliver to our hotel which was 8 minutes away. We were told that it would take 45 minutes to arrive and we reluctantly said ""ok"". We called exactly an hour later and someone else answered and asked ""oh didn't they tell you, it's a Thursday, so it's busy and we are telling everybody an hour and a half..."" What? ""Nooooo..."" That's what my tummy said. Anyhow, by time we got our pizza, although it wasn't hot, and was actually barely warm, I appreciated that it was fresh...in the sense, the dough, sauce, and cheese had a fresh not frozen previously for a month as some pizzas taste, feel to it, that we all enjoyed. The dough could have used some flavor, it had none really, but it did have a good bite. We asked for extra sauce and they delivered on that and the sauce itself was very tasty and made up for the dough, but the cheese, although a good portion, was undercooked to the point that we were chewing each bite for quite a while....

The slices were big and the large was true to size...if it was just cooked for 5 minutes more and the crust had a touch of salt or olive oil in it, anything to give it flavor, then this would easily be 4 stars.

If we are ever in the area again, we might order again, 2 hours before we are hungry, so we can get it in time.",M& I,Local Guide · 212 reviews · 655 photos,5 years ago,3

MisenoIIPizzeriaItalian,"Not just the best Pizza in Carlisle. But, the only good pizza place in Carlisle, we've tried them all.  Everywhere else we've tried has fake tasting cheese, skimp on the sauce and toppings and use bad unseasoned sauce or worse they use frozen pre-made crusts. Not so at Miseno II. Best New York style pizza around. Their burgers and wings are pretty great too.
They do get busy on weekends and holidays so be prepared to wait an hour or more for delivery.  I can guarantee it will be hot, fresh and delicious when you do get it though.  Well worth the wait time.",Brandon Emerich,Local Guide · 31 reviews · 1 photo,9 months ago,5

MisenoIIPizzeriaItalian,"Foods always great until you literally can’t order it, they are almost never open till they’re actually time which is not only listed on their door but also online as well.

MisenoIIPizzeriaItalian,"Such a fun, local, family friendly pizza joint. Their menu is solid, they have a great beer selection, and the service is attentive + friendly. They have a patio that's perfect when the weather is good, otherwise plenty of indoor seating and take out options.

I try to get something new every time I go and I've never been disappointed. Their to-go beer is a little cheaper than the Weis down the street so that's a plus!

Prices overall are super reaonsable and their pizza crust is the best in town. Highly recommend!",Charisse Morrell,Local Guide · 145 reviews · 135 photos,3 years ago,5

MisenoIIPizzeriaItalian,"if I could leave negative stars I would.  We order from Micenos almost weekly and rarely have issues but I am extremely dissapointed in my service today.  This is the 2nd time we called for delivery and the person took our cc # wrong.  last time they called and got the right one but this time they did not.  I called after an hour 10 minutes.  No apologies.  I asked for a manager and the girl said she could help me.  She would not transfer me to someone else. They brought my food out but I did not sign for it.  I asked the delivery driver if I needed to sign and he said no.  I called back after being charged full price. again no apologies and no consideration for my hassles.  I was not asking for free food, just maybe a discount to show we are appreciated.  Nothing.  I told her we would NOT be ordering from them any longer and she said ""ok"".  WOW is all I can say.  What service.",Malee Hetrick,8 reviews,a year ago,1

MisenoIIPizzeriaItalian,"This place is great. I ate there with my son (a Dickinson student), my sister in law and a dear family friend. We ate well AND had leftovers. My linguine and clams was excellent. My sister's seafood bambino looked great. The scampi was good and my son loves his Alfredo. My only knocks are minor ones: as a chef I think that the portion size for the dressings, on the side salads, is too large and the wings in the app platter were not buffalo.",Sean Mudd,Local Guide · 105 reviews · 30 photos,2 years ago,5

MisenoIIPizzeriaItalian,I've eaten here several times.  They have good sandwiches but where I think they shine is with their meals.

MisenoIIPizzeriaItalian,"Dana was a great server. Helpful, checking if food was tasteful and correct. Knowledge of menu was nice, always leary of staff who are not familiar with the options or food they serve. The Sunday pizza special is a hit with us, glad it stuck around. The two large one topping pizzas to go any day of the week is pretty good too!! Seafood chowder is my favorite, can't go wrong with the house made dressing for your salad. But the bread is yum, for subs and for your dinners. It was just like pre-pandemic.",c b,Local Guide · 165 reviews · 70 photos,2 years ago,5

MisenoIIPizzeriaItalian,"They catered my wedding 13 years ago as of Monday and we loved it. Today was my first time back in 13 years and the quality has gotten even better. I had a Sicilian slice which was made to perfection. The sauce was not too sweet and had just enough basil to really set it off. I had a plain slice as well.  And Holy moly.  I was taken back home to NYC. Perfect thin crispy crust,right amount of cheese.

MisenoIIPizzeriaItalian,"Let me start by saying that Miseno's food is okay. It's not bad, but it's not great.  My real problem with them is the delivery. The last time we ordered pizza and a salad from them, it took just under two hours to arrive, and we live within a mile of the restaurant. Every time we called, we were assured it would be there in ""5-10 minutes"".  In the end, we did get our food, but we were not happy with the delay.",Ellie,Local Guide · 44 reviews · 8 photos,4 years ago,3

MisenoIIPizzeriaItalian,We were big fans of Miseno’s for many years. The quality of food has taken a plunge. Don’t order a ham sub or Italian sub. It’s made with horrible cheap meat.

MisenoIIPizzeriaItalian,I am a huge fan of Cheese Steaks. Miseno's makes the best tasting and consistent sub around. Always plenty of meat and fresh. Salads are awesome too. Everything is great.

MisenoIIPizzeriaItalian,Went here tonight for our normal Sunday dinner. We decided to not only get pizza but to try other things. We were highly disappointed. We ordered 2 salads - caesar and buffalo chicken. The caesar has the basics but was nothing impressive. The buffalo chicken salad was definitely not worth it. They do not specify on the menu that the chicken is not fried before tossing in in the sauce. It is done on a flat grill so when it comes time to coat the chicken in sauce barely any of it stays on the chicken. Both salads came with cheese but again they do not specify that it is slices of cheese they cut up and put on top which melts horribly when the chicken is placed on it. I ended up wasting more than half of my salad that I probably could have made at home for half the price. Definitely will not be getting anything other than pizza again.,Kati Rudy,5 reviews · 4 photos,4 years ago,3
MisenoIIPizzeriaItalian,"We had a long day on the road heading north from TN. Stopped for the night in Carlisle, PA.  We googled restaurants and luckily we chose to go to Miseno II.
We were tired and hungry.  The restaurant was very busy, which is always a good sign for us.  They apparently have a booming takeout pizza business.   We found a seat right away and our server, Noah, was there immediately.  We ordered the Chicken Parm and Pasta Carbonara.  Our meals were delicious!  This restaurant is on the ball!  The servers were very friendly and very efficient.  I definately recommend this restaurant!  And I fell in love with what I saw of Carlisle. (The Dickinson College are).

MisenoIIPizzeriaItalian,"Ordering from here wasn’t the least bit pleasant. Being from NY I wasn’t familiar with the area, but  Friday night is always busy in a college town so I picked up the order instead of waiting the 2 hours for delivery. When I called to place my order I wasn’t greeted only told “Miseno!” The short rude young lady took my order than rushed me off the phone without taking my name for the order or confirming she had written everything down correctly. Despite the unpleasant experience I was confident I would shortly be enjoying a good meal with my family.
Arrival to the restaurant it wasn’t too busy maybe a half dozen tables were occupied with guests and literally 20 college age individuals on staff in the kitchen and front of house. I noticed quickly half of the staff were hanging out and talking with one another regardless of how busy this place was supposed to be. I approached the counter and was again met with an unpleasant voice which I could only assume was the young lady I spoke with on the phone. The phone was ringing a lot so again I brushed off the unpleasant feeling bc it appeared to be busy. I paid for my food and left. “Thank God that was over and done with”, I thought to myself. Only to find out once I arrived at my hotel that the order was missing some items. I called the restaurant to mend the mistake but I was simply told that everything was right according to the order. Whoops I guess I should have checked before leaving. But the issue was that I was rushed off the phone when ordering and my order was never correctly taken. The staff didn’t seem to feel empathetic to say the least and simply offered to make it if I was willing to come back and pay for the mistake. By this pint I was done with this restaurant for good and simply agreed that the service wasn’t worth my money or the 15 minute drive from my hotel. Food was decent but not worth my $30 for two entrees dripping with grease through the box. Most of it was thrown out. I will never visit this establishment again when I’m in town.",Brad Casebolt,Local Guide · 14 reviews · 4 photos,5 years ago,1

I told her that I will just pick it up because I live near by. She proceeded to say “ omg I can’t believe this!!” As if she was too bothered to change the order for pickup .  I spoke to Vito who claims to be the manger and was kind. I asked for a refund, which he granted. I have ordered from here every other week and I will not order from here again.

IsseiNoodle,Issei Noodle consistently delivers amazing food and amazing service.  This restaurant has been a staple in Carlisle for years is one of the best Japanese Noodle restaurants I’ve ever been to.,Cory Gardner,Local Guide · 52 reviews · 74 photos,5 months ago,5
IsseiNoodle,"As a huge fan of Ramen noodles, we decided to give this restaurant in downtown Carlisle a try.  The selection is decent. And the food quality and taste is good. Was it the best? No, but it definitely hit the spot as the noodles had the correct softness and bite. The spicy tan tan ramen in the photo was definitely the better of the two ramen we ordered.  The wait staff was friendly and efficient.

If you are from out of town, there is no parking at the restaurant. It is all downtown street parking. We found parking within a block on a Friday night.

This is definitely a place to try and seems to be one of the better Asian food places in the area.",Marcus Haebler,Local Guide · 24 reviews · 7 photos,11 months ago,4
IsseiNoodle,"Came here for lunch on a Friday. It was around 1230. Packed but was seated right away. You order at the front counter and they bring the food to you.

Got the vegetable salad vermicelli bowl. Brother got the beef one. Note: their actual menu is not up-to-date with their online menu, so if you're like me and check out menus online first, don't be afraid to ask if you don't see it on their physical menu.

We were both pleased with our bowls. I initially thought 3 small pieces of fried tofu and fried gyoza wasn't going to be enough, but if you're conservative with your bites, it should be. The gyoza was really good. Nice and crispy. Although I didn't have it, the beef was really fragrant and brother said it was flavorful.

I got the blue-zu with Boba and brother got Thai tea with Boba. Both agreed we didn't like the texture of the boba; too dense. Thai tea didn't taste like Thai tea.",Linh,33 reviews · 54 photos,7 months ago,5
IsseiNoodle,"The building is quite small and the seats are a bit tight, but it is a very cozy setting. Their rice dishes and ramen are very flavorful, as well as their appetizers. The katsu chicken was tender but a bit over breaded and the ramen I ordered (i forget which) was a bit too salty for my taste but both still delicious. The bubble tea (the worst past) was very unflavorful and the bubbles were not a pleasant chewy consistency. I would recommend the FOOD to everyone and the setting was enjoyable.",Rylee Hecht,Local Guide · 18 reviews · 16 photos,8 months ago,4
IsseiNoodle,"If I could rate this a 100/10 I would. Issei is one of the best places hands down. We stop here because of the food and the environment. The Pho is delicious, seasoned well, and the noodles are always cooked to perfection. The Kimchi fried rice is my best friends favorite and it tastes so good. It seasoned well, tastes delicious and has the perfect amount of heat. We also love the Katsudon.(Idk if I spelled that right) it’s delicious crispy fried chicken!! If you are looking for a spot to try new foods this is it. Its a super busy spot, so hurry!! They are closed Sundays & Mondays. They have specials daily. You choose a table and then go to the counter to order.. remember your table number!! They even have a self help spot, that has to go containers and more condiments!

Horrible service snotty stuck up manager( or whatever the lady was). I spent 25 years in the service industry, never have I ever had to deal with such a snotty manager that could not and would not do the right thing.
I gave this place a second chance, the last time I was here over a year ago. I was talked down to like I was a little child.

IsseiNoodle,"I think this place is only rated so high bc there is no local competition. The food is inconsistent here and used to be way better years ago. My son loves gyoza and didn't even one who one bc of the taste. He's never turned down gyoza in his life. My other son wouldn't even eat his chicken pho bc the chicken did taste very old. I tasted it. My shrimp pho was good. I only got one jalapeno though. My daughter's red curry was good. But it's always hit or miss. It is very pricey so when I'm paying I'm hoping to get quality food. I order from here occasionally when I'm sick of other restaurants. I used to love it. Now for ramen or pho I typically wait until I can leave Carlisle. If you go here just be careful what you order. I would go w pho,ramen, or Curry. It's what they do best. The portions are small for what you pay. So if it were me if you can done elsewhere unless you are in a pinch.",Ashley M,Local Guide · 101 reviews · 66 photos,a month ago,2

IsseiNoodle,"My daughter, her husband, and I really like Japanese food. When she got a promotion at work she decided to celebrate at a Japanese restaurant. She found this place on the Internet. This place is small and quite crowded. There is no parking lot but there are many parking meters along the streets and we found a parking garage very close to this restaurant. It is in the downtown area of Carlisle. After we got inside the restaurant, we picked where we wanted to sit. We found the Menus on the table. After we decided what we want to order, we went to the cashier to order and paid for our food then wait at a table to be served. The food and drinks we ordered came rather fast and they were delicious. We ordered fried Gyoza and Tagoyaki for appetizers. There were 6 pieces each. I had Sakura (dry) Ramen and I enjoyed it very much. They were very good and warm. The others ordered Tatan Ramen and Miso Ramen. They also enjoyed their food. My daughter and I each had a glass of Thai tea which we didn't think it had the right aroma of Thai tea. However, I would recommend this place if you are in the area.",Be Holy,Local Guide · 22 reviews · 179 photos,a year ago,4
IsseiNoodle,"Spent the night at Carlisle Barracks and decided on some Japanese. This showed up and we went, it did not disappoint! The prices were really good and we got our food literally 5 minutes after ordering. The food tastes like it came straight from Tokyo, ant the atmosphere was really nice. The biggest challenge is finding parking  since it's metered but it's worth the effort to park and walk. Highly recommended if you are in town.",Ramon Maisonet,"Local Guide · 123 reviews · 1,412 photos",4 years ago,5

IsseiNoodle,"They have gotten really stingy lately. I can understand counting shrimp going into an entree, but my full size chicken yakisoba had exactly ten small pieces of chicken that I had to dig out of a mountain of noodles. I guess it's cheaper to fill up a bowl with noodles and go stingy on the proteins. We've been getting stuff from here for a couple of years, but it's gotten especially bad recently. My wife's pad thai was mostly tasteless (and had a total of six shrimp). The shrimp dumplings were good though.",Ali Tanveer,Local Guide · 29 reviews · 23 photos,a month ago,3
IsseiNoodle,I love this place! And we'll definitely return to sample more from the menu. Our server was great at recommending various dishes. We each tried one and we were all very pleased with our choices. I got the Hanbun Hanbun - one side is Mongolian style beef and the other side is Beef Pho. Great for when you can't decide between a rice dish and a noodle dish. Also worth mentioning is the Plum Green Tea.

The reviews all looked great so I thought I’d have a great experience. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I’m not sure if I just ordered on a bad day, but the ramen was very bland, the noodles were overcooked and the boba was honestly some of the worst boba I’ve ever had in my life. Not impressed and for $25 I won’t be trying them again!",Bree,9 reviews,3 months ago,2

IsseiNoodle,"I'm very confused.

Atmosphere: comfortable and quiet
Seating: tight, but workable
Employees: welcoming

Food...

This was my first time here. After looking at the website, and reading the reviews, damn, I was very excited to try this place. My husband and I spent about $47.

Food review and some notes down below—

Fried tofu:  beyond saturated in oil
Veggie eggrolls: decent

D2 chicken & egg: mild flavor, and very misleading. $16 for like 2 cups of rice and about 4 nickle sized pieces of chicken and 2 small peices of bokchoy. The egg was mixed in. Maybe 1 egg. Maybe.

Anyway, it had a mild flavor that I enjoyed, my husband ate 3-4 bites and gave up because he couldn't taste anything and he didn't feel like gorging on rice after he had his ""portion"" of the nickle size chicken, which I understand.

I'm actually a diabetic, and so as I'm writing this, my heart is going 90 miles a minute because I shouldn't have eaten as much rice as I had, however, I was hungry, and wasn't given much choice seeing that the porptions of food at this place is about 94% carbs —at least for what we ordered.

Chicken Pho: this was a confusing item for me. Everything was made fresh, and the chicken was SO SO SO tender (again, nickle size, I think I got maybe 8 nickle sized pieces, however this dish was only $10), but there was no flavor. I put my single slice of jalapeno into my bowl after tearing it into 3 small pieces, I squeezed my line and used up all my basil.

That was the only flavor in the soup. The lime and basil, and it was surface flavor, because it was limited and a garnish.

The broth, if you could call it that, was just warm salted water.

The chicken was not seasoned, despite being so tender.

This was frustrating because everything was fresh, everything was tender, but ultimately, we didn't eat it and left it nearly entirely entact and walked out because it was the most underwhelming PHO I have ever eaten in my entire life and I am not kidding. I've been around. I know what Pho tastes like, and that was not it. Didn't even come close. Which is a shame, because if the flavor had been there, I'd be eating there weekly.",Sarah Hutson,10 reviews,2 days ago,1
IsseiNoodle,"A favorite, must stop for authentic ramen - spicey tan tan.  Used to be super spicey, has been dialed back a bit, but still yummo.  This place is always packed, closes for lunch at 2:15. Worth the wait.",Melissa Raj,Local Guide · 135 reviews · 213 photos,4 years ago,5
IsseiNoodle,"Great dining with a variety of noodle dishes! Craving a bowl of ramen I was pleasantly surprised to find an location with such a delicious and authentic tasting bowl!

The Black Garlic Ramen hit the spot just right, solid garlic flavor but not over powering. The bowl is very generous in size and they're also generous with the chashu.

The Egg Rolls were freshly made, crispy and hot!

And the viet iced coffee was perfect, not too sweet nor too strong of a kick.

Great find for this small town!",Quan Doan,Local Guide · 143 reviews · 678 photos,a year ago,4
IsseiNoodle,The food is great but it’s all meaningless if you can’t get the food - hours are just awful and turning people away.

IsseiNoodle,"Nice neighborhood noodle place. I ordered the veggie udon, green tea, and mochi ice cream for dessert. My friend ordered the vegetarian vermicelli (think salad). Everything was great; love that they have a whole vegetarian conscious section of the menu. Spicy add ons are situated at the side of every table along with chopsticks and metal utensils- saves time having to ask for them. Free refills on green tea, the black sesame seed mochi was surprisingly delicious. This place closes around 2pm and reopens at 5 at which  time they seem to get busy pretty quickly. Off street parking like every other place on this street so it can be kind of difficult to get close to. Overall enjoyed my experience and would recommend.",bee Johnson,Local Guide · 114 reviews · 174 photos,5 years ago,4

IsseiNoodle,"I went today to try something different. I usually get the kar aged chicken. Anyways, I was feeling under the weather so I decided to get some miso ramen to feel better.

I immediately attempted to call the restaurant to report but was greeted by a recording telling me that all orders must be placed online and to contact customer service you must go through email or facebook.  WOW..... very disappointing since i was enjoying the food.   Major reduction in stars.   A couple of other dings.... food was delivered to my hotel without utensils.... it's usually a safe bet that a person at a hotel does not bring silverware with them.  Lastly the ginger ale delivered in a cup 3/4 full of crushed ice so very little drink with lots of ice.

The space isn’t huge but has a lot of personal touches. You seat yourself and order at the register with your table number, and I thought both servers were polite and helpful.

IsseiNoodle,"Drove 20 mins on a Saturday evening around 5pm and they were closed despite their hours online saying otherwise. Pretty disappointing especially after I spent another 10 mins to find parking that I paid for.

Even the few times I have managed to eat there it was a pretty uncomfortable experience - being forced to share tables in tight spaces with strangers and the long line to order your food is pretty obtrusive while you’re trying to eat.

Food is good and pretty authentic.. however I did have a piece of plastic in my bowl of ramen the last time I went.

Why did I drive 20 mins to go back after all of that you might ask? Because it’s the ONLY ramen in south central PA. And I love me some ramen.

IsseiNoodle,"Best ramen I've had in a long while and certainly anywhere in this area...and I'm half Asian, so I'm a harsh critic. It's so good it makes up for the service and atmosphere it lacks. Service is meh but passable.  Between the single tiny bathroom, the self serve condiments station, and the cold outside air wafting in every few minutes when someone came thru the single front door (no inner / outer door buffer setup) it reminds you of to a small, shabby diner....nothing wrong with the atmosphere, there just isn't any. Not the place to impress a date but a good place to quickly grab some great ramen.",Frank Vaccaro,Local Guide · 13 reviews · 1 photo,a year ago,4
IsseiNoodle,"Very nice place, it was clean and staff was nice. Food was amazing. Got the Black Garlic Ramen. The garlic taste was perfect, not overwhelming, but not underwhelming either. Ramen is about $15 per bowl. There are extras you can add on, but trust me, the bowls are plenty filling without. Also had the Stawberry Milk Tea which was very good as well. Highly recommend this place.

IsseiNoodle,"Super great food! Lots of variety and amazing flavor. A new personal favorite.

However, according to their website, they do not let you change the ingredients of a dish so be mindful if you have allergies or restrictions. I didn't have any issues though since they have such a large menu!",Veronica,26 reviews · 8 photos,a year ago,5

IsseiNoodle,"The food is good, but how good does a bowl of noodles have to be in order to be $16 plus dollars?  I'm not cheap, but there's a limit to how much I will pay for a specific thing... noodles don't make it to sixteen bucks, no matter what you fry in a wok and throw on top.",Matthew Romano,Local Guide · 30 reviews · 7 photos,a year ago,2

IsseiNoodle,"Just go in, grab a table, look at the menu, go to the register and tell them what you want (shrimp dumplings, spicy tan tan ramen). They'll bring it in a moment. While you wait, figure out what you'll have next time, because you'll be back. Off peak is best. It's typically crowded because it's so good.",Jason T,Local Guide · 33 reviews · 15 photos,a year ago,5

IsseiNoodle,"What a cool place!! I went there on Valentine's day for a fun thing to do, and I was certainly not disappointed with this little jewel of an eatery. Dress and atmosphere are casual, prices are very reasonable,  and best yet, I needed a dietary change on my meal and they not only generously cooperated but brought me a wonderful bowl of sprout to replace the noodles I could not eat. The entire staff was extremely friendly. I would absolutely take friends from out of town here for a great meal!",Erin Moul,Local Guide · 59 reviews,4 years ago,5

IsseiNoodle,"I've gotten food from here many times before, but I haven't been back since last August and now I remember why. Not worth the price, the food was bland, the Boba was under cooked and the packaging was so small for the contents. I was overall disatisfied with the experience. Also if ordering delivery why not just make It available through door dash if you're going to use the service to deliver your food anyways? Then I'd be able to review the door dasher who almost delivered my food somewhere else. All in all I'm not going to be ordering from here again. It's a shame to see what was once a really good restaurant with food packed with flavor give out food this bland. Also on their website they are offering gift cards for reviews so buyer beware.",Sarah Wellborn,6 reviews · 1 photo,2 years ago,1
IsseiNoodle,"Decent food but not generous portions, at least of the Pad Thai. All sprouts, too few noodles, meat, and nuts. Thai iced tea was quite good but just those two things put lunch over $30 with tip. Won’t be going back",Abram Trosky,4 reviews,a year ago,3
IsseiNoodle,"The first time I came to Issei was back in 2019 when I first started at my current job Aerotek, Carlisle. I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai and it has been my favorite dish on the menu since. My coworker took me to lunch to get to know me better and ever since it has been a huge foundation for business development lunches with my team. Over the growth of my career the past 4 years, I have also had the pleasure to see your business flourish and everything you have overcome with COVID-19. Thank you for always providing top notch food and service. You will always be an Aerotek favorite. Thank you for always making us feel apart of the Issei Phamily. :)",Sydney Curfman,3 reviews,a year ago,5

IsseiNoodle,"Issei was good with their food before, however, in the recent years, they started to serve customers with instant noodles seasoning bags and the noodles were all from instant noodle packages. And their price is extremely high for a noodle store in a place like carlisle (they have no competitors), their noodle sells for about $20, which is even higher than some places in Philly or New York. Again, local Americans, this is not real Japanese Ramen anymore, it was before, but not anymore.",Han Wu,10 reviews · 1 photo,11 months ago,2
IsseiNoodle,"I see a lot of people chastising this restaurant for being cautious during a pandemic. Disregard those reviews because they are now irrelevant and do not accurately reflect the experience. The ramen is, hands down, some of the best I’ve had (and I’ve had my fair share of bowls). The prices are reasonable, the food quality is superb. My noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth exceeded my expectations. Give this place a chance, you won’t be disappointed.",Tyler Myers,Local Guide · 29 reviews · 1 photo,2 years ago,5
IsseiNoodle,"I live in a small town that doesn’t have much when it comes to variety. I have a passion for authenticity, even when it comes to food.

If you want authentic, delicious ramen, go to Issei Noodle!",Noah Martin,3 reviews · 2 photos,a year ago,5
IsseiNoodle,"The food is pretty good as it always has been, the new employees on the other hand are so much worse than before. There was a blonde woman there asking a bunch of questions and didn’t know what she was doing. Which was fine with me because it looked like her first day. I then waited an hour for my food to be made and my name was called. When I went up I was looking at the bags and the new woman working gave me a ton of attitude just for me touching the bags to see if they were mine. My name was just called how would I not know that my order wasn’t up there yet?.... just a bad customer service experience overall the food was decent though. I expected more from this spot as I have been here before and had a great experience. Sadly, there customer service has since fallen short and I will be taking my patronage elsewhere in the future.",Brooke Rhodes,9 reviews,2 years ago,1
IsseiNoodle,Went out to lunch with a small group of coworkers.  Pleasantly greeted as we walked in and sat down immediately at a table.  Minutes later we ordered and food was fresh and hot delivered to the table in no time.   I had the Sakura Dry Ramen 17A.  🥳🎉🤗🥰So good.  We order here all the time and have always been incredibly happy with the food and the service.  Definitely a must visit in the Carlisle area.,Mark Mcnutt,Local Guide · 37 reviews · 3 photos,a year ago,5
IsseiNoodle,"Was an amazing little restaurant that I would highly recommend. I lived in York and had to come up for business. Honestly I'd come back even if I didn't have business. My only gripe was that I didn't immediately know I had to walk up to the counter to order. But that's on me, not the restaurant.",Austin Shoemaker,Local Guide · 87 reviews · 56 photos,a year ago,5
IsseiNoodle,"The food is always amazing at Issei!  It can get quite full during peak meal times, which is a sign of how good it is, so be early or be prepared that you may have to wait a bit. Service is fast, polite,  and efficient. There's also a small area where you can buy items from Japan.",Ashley Newhard,19 reviews · 47 photos,a year ago,5
IsseiNoodle,"I have been a long time fan is Issei — I went there regularly at the beginning of the pandemic because I was worried about their business having difficulties during that time and I have an Issei sweatshirt customized with my favorite order at the restaurant.

However, my recent experience there was one of the worst I have ever had at any restaurant. I went in to order in person and when I went to make my usual order I was told that I could not ask for them to exclude ANYTHING from my dish, even things I was allergic to due to the fact that all of these items were “essential to the character of the dish” and without them it would not be “correct and complete.” I was left unable to even order any food due to the pressure they placed on me.  The staff was rude and condescending about the entire experience. I am sorry to say this but I will not be back for a long time, I may never return. This seems to be a new management directive and I am so disappointed — Issei was one of my favorite restaurants and I had so many good experiences there. 😢",Kris Rhinehart,1 review,2 years ago,1
IsseiNoodle,Easily one of the best restaurants in Carlisle. Well worth the visit. Tremendous variety of Asian dishes. Great atmosphere and service despite it always being busy. Have eaten here several times and always had a delicious meal. A little pricey for the portions you get but still a must do.,George Shatzer,128 reviews · 11 photos,5 years ago,5
IsseiNoodle,"This place is legit, must try!! My wife and I have moved around a lot and have sought out Pho and Noodles everywhere we've gone. This is now our ""go to"" place in Carlisle. They have fantastic wheat-based ramen, along with delicious apps. We can't wait to try the Pho and the rest of their entrees.",Johnathon Nelson,13 reviews,a year ago,5
IsseiNoodle,"The food was delicious! Service was excellent. Price was fair for what we received. My only concern was that everywhere it says they only do take out. This isn't strictly true. They wrap up everything take out style but you can sit inside and eat. Keep in mind that they package the ramen broth separate from the noodles if you want to eat ramen under their roof. I simply dipped my soup ingredients into the broth which was still delightful but alas, my noodles didn't soak up the broth flavors... 1st world problems... Five stars, will eat there again, and will bring friends",Michael Schumer,21 reviews · 2 photos,2 years ago,5
IsseiNoodle,"This place is fantastic! Definitely will be back! As far as atmosphere it is great. The staff is really friendly, nice, and helpful. As well as quick. My boyfriend and I ordered everything at once, but we still got our small dish first and then our entrees after with great timing. I ordered the Black Garlic Ramen (10A) and it was delicious! As well as the Fried Gyoza and those were amazing! Great flavor in all the dishes! Can't wait to come back and try everything else!",Rice O' Roni,Local Guide · 9 reviews · 7 photos,4 years ago,5
IsseiNoodle,"Honestly everything is good about this place. The big quirks it has is that you don't have to wait to be seated, you just tell them how many and choose a place to sit. Or waiting for a waiter/waitress to bring your receipt, you pay up front when done. So the service is fast for everyone's convenience. Your dish always comes out warm and done well. Great place, keep it up the good work!",HoneySonya,16 reviews · 1 photo,5 years ago,5

IsseiNoodle,Stopped by Issei last weekend for dinner.  Hubs ordered the Black Garlic Ramen and I ordered the Shrimp Tempura Don-Buri.  Both were EXCELLENT.  Service was quick and pleasant; place was clean.  Will definitely be back to sample more of the menu. Highly recommended.,Jennifer Ivey,Local Guide · 41 reviews · 8 photos,2 years ago,5
IsseiNoodle,"Got the haru ramen and was absolutely delighted. I'd give this place 5 stars if it weren't for the fact it's not BYOB, my partner was served his entree about ten minutes before me, and it's very very hot inside. Definitely come on a cool day or dress accordingly. Food wise though you can't find a better ramen house on the west shore. I'd say get take out and eat it at home :)",Jennifer Anderson,Local Guide · 63 reviews · 5 photos,a year ago,4

IsseiNoodle,"Horrible customer service from the girl in front, I didn’t want bean sprouts in my soup and instead of just making a new one and giving the to-go soup to the next customer she asked me if I would pick them out. What made the experience horrible was how she was giving me attitude for no reason very unprofessional The food is amazing and I always have a great time when I come here. Hope this issue gets resolved in the future :)",Esperanza Moreno,8 reviews · 2 photos,a year ago,1
IsseiNoodle,"PHO!!!! This is the only place to go in town if you want an amazing bowl of pho during the week. There is a wide array of Asian fusion food as well, but we go for that soup. We also have to get bubble tea when we are there. It’s the only place we’ve seen that does it well in Carlisle. It’s right on the main drag in Carlisle and near the theater and the other restaurants. It feels cozy inside with nice furnishing and you can see the cooking staff at work. Great place to eat and relax in Carlisle!!",Robert Halvorson,Local Guide · 15 reviews · 1 photo,3 years ago,5
IsseiNoodle,This is mine and my wife’s number one restaurant of choice. We moved away from PA 2 years ago and when I found out I had a business trip in the area two weeks ago the first thing my wife said jokingly said was “can you mail be back some Issei?” And it did not disappoint. 17a is as absolute classic but don’t sleep on 10d,steven garris,10 reviews,2 years ago,5

IsseiNoodle,"Five stars for service, the thai tea and quickness of food served. They had quite a large crowd, but seated people quickly; however, both the dishes we had were not very good and really lacked flavor.

We were a little disappointed, considering their reviews and full house. I think they tend to ""Americanize"" their dishes, which suits some palettes and not others.",Chelsea Hall,Local Guide · 21 reviews · 2 photos,5 years ago,3

IsseiNoodle,"I am Asian, so finding a good restaurant worthy of spending my money at is always a challenge. Especially in a suburban district. I’ve been holding out on a review, but this one is for the Asian community searching for authenticity! I have lived in urban areas for a long time and have had the real thing growing up in my home. This place is more of a hipster interpretation of Asian cuisine that you’d find in a city. This is not a compliment by any means. My rating for this restaurant is a low 3 only because of the variety of soups available and because of vegetable additions available (broccoli is also not authentic in ramen, but it meets the wants of the customers) I have tried the ramen, wonton, and pho here. I was patient and kept coming back to give other dishes a chance, but I am not impressed with any of the soups to be honest. I’ve given them 3 tries and each time was a disappointment. It may look decadent but the taste isn’t there. They do not taste authentic. They’re all overpriced. You can trick the locals, but I’ll be driving 25 minutes to Camp Hill, if I’m craving a real authentic bowl of  pho with the real cuts of beef. I was most upset about the special wonton soup here. The wontons were not filled with shrimp and pork. They were more like frozen bought fish cakes wrapped in wonton wrappers. There were also only 2 shrimps, 3 wontons, a sliver of bok choy and a small serving of ground park. The soup tasted like lightly seasoned pork water. For $13, it was not worth it. I will not be returning.",Alexis T,Local Guide · 11 reviews · 8 photos,2 years ago,3

IsseiNoodle,"Very cool place! I went during lunch on a Saturday, so it was very busy. The service was excellent and the food was amazing. Many options for everyone!

IsseiNoodle,"Normally wouldn't give a place 4 stars after they'd forgotten to put in my order but the food was so good and the small plates came quickly so I wasn't too put out.

IsseiNoodle,"It does a good job satisfying a craving, but I wouldn't really consider any of it authentic Asian food. I lived and traveled in East Asia for 2.5 years, so I've had my fair share of authentic Asian food in a variety of countries. The food at Issei is high quality, quickly made, and tastes pretty good, but don't come expecting the quality of ramen, dumplings, pho, etc. that you'd find in Asia or even in a bigger US city. That being said, I'll definitely go back for ramen again as it satisfies the craving when I can't get to a bigger city.",Jim Cheney,8 reviews,2 years ago,4

IsseiNoodle,My experience here was terrible! My dish as cooked with cilantro which was not listed on the menu as being in the dish; this is why I ordered it. There was cilantro on the top which I took off & put to the side as I thought it was a garnish. I tried eating some and it was mixed throughout the dish. I ate some trying to pick it out. I asked the waiter if they could make another one without the cilantro as it was listed on the menu. The waiter & the manager/cook both said no. The manager/cook was yelling at me about something she cooked wrong. She told me I had to pay the full amount for the meal or she'd call the cops! They also made my sister pay $2.00 for tea that said $1.25 on the menu. And these people have Christian references on their menu! Pitiful establishment concerned only with the almighty dollar with  NO customer service!,Pam Williams,1 review · 1 photo,7 years ago,1

IsseiNoodle,"Brought my parents there yesterday for a Saturday lunch.  There was only 1 person waiting the tables.  Even after we had taken turns to go to the restroom, still no one came to take our orders. I had to personally go and flag down the waitress.  Anyways, the food did come quickly after orders were made and by and large still quite good except for my Dad's ramen soup which was way too salty despite our special instruction for low salt.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, I wasn't the least bit amused by the commercialism conveyed  by this supposedly charming local operation: that our party of 4 adult plus 1 child was considered a party and was levied a mandatory 18% service fees.  We left with a ""bad after-taste"" --  deserving enough for a mark down from my previous rating.",David H,"Local Guide · 247 reviews · 3,696 photos",5 years ago,3
IsseiNoodle,Had two parties of three sitting at separate tables and waitress would not write more than one check for us. We were told by another waitress they would.The Vietnamese lady with blue eyes was not accomodating at all. It wasn't very busy in the resturant I'm guessing she's one of the reasons why. I used to go with friends at least ×2 a month...You lost our business completely. They used to be nice people now just greedy and money hungry. The customer is never right if you have an issue.,Sharon Ambrose,Local Guide · 49 reviews,4 years ago,1
IsseiNoodle,"Wow! I have tried many things on the menu but I always try to get something different when I come here. I recently got the 10A. Black garlicramen. It was absolutely fantastic in every way. Best bowl of ramen I have ever had. It will probably become my togo order after I try a new dish.

IsseiNoodle,"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Carlisle (and probably the whole world). My personal favorites are the pad thai and vegetarian vermicelli noodle salad with gyoza, but literally everything on their menu is good. For apps, I love the spring rolls and potato shrimp. The Vietnamese iced coffee is also a must for a warm day. If you're already stuffed from their generous portions, get the coffee to-go. The service here is also awesome, always fast and friendly.

IsseiNoodle,"The soup ramen was really good. However, their other items like fried rice and stir fried noodles tasted odd to me, but this could just be a personal preference.

IsseiNoodle,"Beyond a shadow of a doubt the absolute BEST noodles I've had in a looooong time.

The Vietnameese egg rolls are fantastic, the fish sauce with it is incredible.

I had the #23 Egg Noodle Delight.  I had them spice it up for me (15 on the scale) and I can't believe how well the spice and the sweet complimented each other.  Plenty of meat, a HUGE portion of noodles and the right amount of vegetables made this dish one of my absolute favorites.  I'll be bringing my wife and son by again real soon so they can be spoiled from eating noodles anywhere else along with me.

The price was more than modest for what I got and the service was fast, friendly and their hospitality was beyond reproach.

5 Star, I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for some good noodles.",Norman White,Local Guide · 8 reviews · 9 photos,8 years ago,5

Stealing from my dates bowl I have to say his Tom-Yum beef noodle will be my next order when we come back. We also had the issei bao pork buns as an appetizer along with the shrimp dumplings. The buns were so good we forgot to take a pic, maybe next time.",M T C,Local Guide · 169 reviews · 94 photos,5 years ago,5
IsseiNoodle,"I have been coming to Issei for over 10 years. I have spent thousands at Issei and even held multiple parties at Issei when they had the larger room.

Throughout the years I have ordered Don Buri without rice to reduce my carb content due to IBS and health goals.

On 04/14/22 I was told I could not order the Don Buri without rice because I wouldn’t like it and it wouldn’t be right.

Naomi would have never allowed such a thing to happen. She was always so accommodating and warm and now the staff is insensitive and unreasonable. The character of the Don Buri would still be preserved without rice as all the flavors would still be present. White rice actually has little to no flavor so their refusal to leave off the rice is solely a personal selfish choice to have it their way.

I was a good customer and sent hundreds of people their way from word of mouth, by hosting parties there and also supporting them on social media.

I will never be your customer again after such rude treatment and poor business practices.",Virginia Diggs,Local Guide · 84 reviews · 82 photos,2 years ago,1

IsseiNoodle,"Issei is the most authentic Japanese food I've experienced in Central PA. The owner is from Osaka (the food Capitol of Japan) and it shows! The Shoyu Ramen and Karaage are a must order! I previously spent 4 months in Japan and the food couldn't be more authentic. I will be coming back to this restaurant as long as I am living in the area. Make a reservation and enjoy. The food is absolutely worth the wait!
thank you!",R.L. H.,35 reviews · 13 photos,a month ago,5
